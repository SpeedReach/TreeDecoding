: Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter star, turns 18 and gains access to a reported £20 million fortune. However, he plans not to be extravagant, preferring to spend on books, CDs, and DVDs. Despite his fame and wealth, Radcliffe aims to stay grounded, avoiding the "kid star goes off the rails" stereotype. He will continue his Harry Potter role in the last two films, while also working on other projects like "My Boy Jack," "December Boys," and a stage debut in "Equus." He anticipates increased media scrutiny as an adult.
: CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien explores the "forgotten floor" of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, where mentally ill inmates await trial. Judge Steven Leifman, an advocate for justice and the mentally ill, explains that these individuals often face avoidable felonies due to confrontations with police, exacerbating their mental health issues. The conditions on the ninth floor are harsh, with no shoes, laces, or mattresses to prevent self-harm. Approximately one-third of Miami-Dade county jail inmates are mentally ill, overwhelming the system. Leifman aims to change this by redirecting inmates to a new mental health facility starting in 2008, offering long-term treatment instead of repeated incarceration. This initiative is seen as a win-win solution, benefiting patients, families, and the state.

No abnormalities were found during Bush's last colonoscopy in June 2002. The American Cancer Society recommends screening for colorectal cancer at age 50 for those without high risk factors or symptoms.
: Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick has been indefinitely suspended by the NFL without pay due to his involvement in a dogfighting ring. Vick admitted to federal prosecutors in Virginia that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not perform well in fighting sessions. The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, stated that Vick's actions were illegal, cruel, and tarnished the NFL's reputation. The Falcons could seek to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from his 2004 contract. Vick is expected to plead guilty to conspiracy charges related to the dogfighting ring and may face up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement, and Vick has agreed to cooperate with investigators and make restitution for the costs associated with the seized dogs.

: Six miners trapped in a Utah coal mine for nearly a month have been declared dead with "no remaining hope" of finding them alive. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) exhausted all known options after drilling seven holes into mine tunnels, finding no sign of the miners or any sound from them. Oxygen levels in the mine were too low to sustain human life.

: A study suggests that the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) found in healthy Australian honey bees may contribute to colony collapse disorder (CCD) in U.S. bee colonies. IAPV was present in bees from CCD hives 96% of the time. However, researchers caution that CCD is likely caused by multiple factors, including genetic weakness, pathogens, pesticides, pollutants, and varroa mites, which are not found in Australia. The study offers hope for breeding disease- and pest-resistant bees, as some bees show genetic resistance to IAPV. Further research is needed to determine if IAPV alone or in combination with other factors can induce CCD in healthy bees.

: Paul Lee, a chief subway technician in Hong Kong, paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a liver transplant from an executed Chinese prisoner, saving his life. In Egypt, Karam paid $5,300 to buy a kidney for his sister. Hakan, a security guard in Istanbul, is seeking $30,700 for one of his kidneys. The dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries has led to organ trafficking and a black market, with foreigners traveling to poorer countries like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia, and the Philippines to buy body parts. The World Health Organization estimates a global demand of at least 90,000 liver transplants annually, far exceeding the 20,000 carried out in China, which recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners. In Pakistan, a "kidney bazaar" has emerged, with patients from Europe, Saudi Arabia, and India paying around $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors receive $300 to $1,000 with no medical care post-surgery. Efforts to regulate or ban the trade face challenges due to unclear laws and vested interests.
: Hollywood filmmakers are debating whether to insure Lindsay Lohan's future movies following her recent legal troubles.

Despite their disagreements, both acknowledged the need for health care reform in the U.S.
: Some Democrats are reconsidering their support for a House resolution that labels Turkey's treatment of Armenians during World War I as genocide. Turkey, a key U.S. ally and NATO partner, threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base, a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and the Mideast and Asia, if the resolution passes. The Pentagon is exploring alternative supply routes, including Jordan and Kuwait, in case Turkey restricts U.S. access to Incirlik. The U.S. military has issued a warning order to prepare alternative air crews, planes, fuel, and routes. There are concerns that pursuing the resolution could embolden Turkey to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, further destabilizing the region.

: Over 100 homes in an upscale San Diego community were evacuated due to a landslide that occurred on Wednesday. The landslide, which was about 60 yards wide, caused the earth to shift beneath a three-lane road and some multimillion-dollar homes. Residents were allowed to return to 75 of the evacuated homes by early Thursday, while nine homes were red tagged and 27 were yellow tagged. The landslide also caused power outages and a minor gas leak, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday. The area has a history of landslides dating back to the 1960s due to unstable soil.
: Zoe's Ark, a French charity, attempted to take 103 children from Chad to France for adoption. However, it was revealed that most of these children were neither Sudanese nor orphans. Instead, they were living with their families in Chadian villages near the Chad-Sudan border. The charity was accused of kidnapping and concealing the children's identities. Six members of Zoe's Ark, along with three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew, and one Belgian, were arrested. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and UNICEF are investigating the children's backgrounds. French authorities condemned the charity's actions as illegal and irresponsible. The Republic of Congo suspended all international adoptions in response to the situation. Reporters Without Borders called for the release of the journalists.
: Explorer Dennis Schmitt discovered an island near Greenland, now known as Warming Island, which was previously thought to be a peninsula. The melting ice revealed the distinct island, serving as a significant example of climate change. Many scientists attribute this warming trend to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. However, a minority of scientists argue that these changes are part of the Earth's natural cyclical patterns. The implications of this warming trend, if unchecked, could lead to catastrophic changes in the world's climate and geography, including rising sea levels and altered weather patterns. The scientific community remains divided on the causes and future implications of this phenomenon.

The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures but raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia.
: Stacy Peterson, a 23-year-old suburban Chicago police sergeant's wife, has been missing since October 28.

: Attacks in northeastern Baghdad have decreased by 75% recently, leading Army Col. Don Farris, commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, to state that security is "dramatically improving."

The networks, which transmit from Dubai, had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. The ban prevents the networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. The Pakistani government has made several demands of the networks, including "dulling down the content" and removing certain anchors and hosts. Musharraf's emergency order restricts journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to Pakistan's ideology or integrity, covering suicide bombings and militant activity, and ridiculing members of the government or armed forces. Some smaller television channels have complied with the government's restrictions, while GEO and ARY have refused. Opposition leaders accuse Musharraf of declaring emergency rule to maintain his power.
