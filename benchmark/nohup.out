: The seed lexicon consists of 15 positive words and 15 negative words, as mentioned in Section SECREF27. These words are used to assign polarity scores to events based on their predicates.
: The aspects compared between various language models in the document are perplexity, R@3 in next-word prediction, latency (ms/query), and energy usage (mJ/query).
: The document does not specify which baselines were compared in the study. It only mentions the baseline model from See et al. See2017 trained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
: The document targets Brazilian Portuguese. It mentions "In Brazil, the use of such technique has been widely diffused gaining more space" and discusses the analysis of gender bias in Portuguese word embeddings.
err
: I don't know.
: The document measures quality by comparing UniSent with the Baseline-Lexicon and the gold standard lexicon for general domain data, as well as comparing UniSent with the gold standard emoticon lexicon in the Twitter domain. The results of these comparisons show the performance of UniSent in terms of outperforming the baseline and being close to manually annotated data. However, the document does not specify the exact metrics or methods used for measuring quality.
: The sample size of people used to measure user satisfaction is 34,432 user conversations.
: I don't know. The document does not specify whether the authors' work is limited to English or if it includes other languages as well.
: Random Forest Ensemble classifiers are used for the classification tasks.
: I don't know.
: I don't know.
: I don't know. The document does not provide specific details about the experiments conducted by the authors to validate their system.
: The document does not provide specific details on how robustness is measured in the experiments.
: The document does not specify which ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system(s) are used in this work. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
: Yes, the document states that the semantic hierarchy representation generated by the discourse-aware syntactic text simplification (TS) approach can be used to facilitate and improve a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. These tasks include Machine Translation, Information Extraction (IE), Text Summarization, and Open Information Extraction (Open IE). The semantic hierarchy helps in enriching the output of Open IE systems with contextual information, enhancing the interpretability of complex assertions.
: The document does not provide information on how the author's work ranked among other submissions on the challenge. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
: The German-English dataset used in the study consisted of 159,000 parallel sentences for training, 1,000 for development, and 2,000 for testing.
: Mathur et al. in their paper for detecting offensive tweets proposed a Ternary Trans-CNN model where they train a model architecture comprising of 3 layers of Convolution 1D having filter sizes of 15, 12 and 10 and kernel size of 3 followed by 2 dense fully connected layer of size 64 and 3. The first dense FC layer has ReLU activation while the last Dense layer had Softmax activation. They were able to train this network on a parallel English dataset provided by Davidson et al. and achieved Accuracy of 83.9%, Precision of 80.2%, and Recall of 69.8%.
: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Experiments show that word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool, even when provided with a large parallel corpus. This suggests that word-level semantics are well captured by mBERT contextual embeddings.

2. Learning an explicit projection of the representations had a negligible effect on the performance of word-alignment, indicating that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings already captures sufficient semantic information for this task.

3. The tSNE plot of language centroids (Figure FIGREF9) shows that the similarity of the centroids tends to correspond to the similarity of the languages, further supporting the idea that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings captures semantic similarities across languages.

These points collectively demonstrate that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is capable of capturing sufficient semantic information for high-accuracy word-alignment tasks.
: I don't know. The document does not provide specific performance metrics or results for the system.

: Yes, the document states that they use the state-of-the-art model, specifically the ESIM model, to analyze the attention.
: The document provides Spearman's ρ, Kendall's τ, and Pearson's r correlation results in Table TABREF23, but the specific values are not included in the provided text. To find the exact correlation results, one would need to refer to Table TABREF23 in the original document. Since the specific values are not provided in the text, the answer is "I don't know."
: The document mentions incorporating phrase-based word embedding for improved vocabulary mapping and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for generating more accurate target code for each line in the future phases of the research.
: The document states that the CNN model outperformed autoencoders and MLP with the highest achieved accuracy of 82.6%. Therefore, the CNN model performed better.
: I don't know. The document does not specify whether the results are reported only on English data.
: The document does not specify whether the results are reported only on English data. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
: The source of the OpenIE extractions was a corpus consisting of domain-targeted 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages, used by BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining.
: The authors hypothesize that the dense approach substantially boosts the performance of the sparse approach due to its implicit handling of similar words through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. This smoothing capability reduces sparseness, which is why they recommend using the dense approach in further studies.
: Kyubyong Park and Edouard Grave's pre-trained word embeddings were used.
: I don't know.
: I don't know.
: The document does not specify the names or details of the datasets used. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."

: I don't know.
: The syntactic analysis shows that the method enables controlling the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, along with verbs and adjectives related to them. Specifically, it demonstrates an increase in the number of feminine-marked verbs when the "She said" prefix is used, bringing the proportion closer to that of the reference translation, though still under-predicting some feminine cases. For the audience, adding the "to them" condition brings the proportion of plural second-person pronouns much closer to that of the reference translation. The analysis confirms the effectiveness of the method in influencing the morphological decisions of the NMT system.
: The document mentions two normalization techniques: cepstral mean normalization (CMN) and using deltas and delta-deltas.
: The evaluation metrics used in the document are AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) and top-1 accuracy.
: The document represents textual documents using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weights within a Vector Space Model (VSM). Each document is represented as a vector of TF-IDF weights.

err
: I don't know.
: The document measures quality by comparing UniSent with the Baseline-Lexicon and the gold standard lexicon for general domain data, as well as comparing it with the gold standard emoticon lexicon in the Twitter domain. The results of these comparisons show the performance of UniSent in terms of outperforming the baseline and being close to manually annotated data. However, the document does not specify the exact metrics or methods used for measuring quality.
: The document states that there were a total of 34,432 user conversations analyzed for Gunrock.

: Yes, the document states that the semantic hierarchy representation generated by the discourse-aware syntactic text simplification approach can be used to facilitate and improve a variety of AI tasks. This includes tasks like Machine Translation, Information Extraction (IE), Text Summarization, and Open IE systems. The semantic hierarchy helps in enriching the output of these systems with contextual information, improving their accuracy and interpretability. Therefore, the semantic hierarchy representation is indeed used for various tasks.
: The document does not provide information on how the author's work ranked among other submissions on the challenge. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
: The German-English dataset used in the study consisted of 159,000 parallel sentences for training, 1,000 for development, and 2,000 for testing.
: The previous work's model mentioned in the document is the Ternary Trans-CNN model proposed by Mathur et al. for detecting offensive tweets. This model comprises of 3 layers of Convolution 1D with filter sizes of 15, 12, and 10 and kernel size of 3 followed by 2 dense fully connected layer of size 64 and 3. The first dense FC layer has ReLU activation while the last Dense layer had Softmax activation. They achieved an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 80.2%, and recall of 69.8%.
: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool, even when provided with a large parallel corpus. This suggests that word-level semantics are well captured by mBERT contextual embeddings.

2. Learning an explicit projection of the representations had a negligible effect on the performance of word-alignment, indicating that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings already captures sufficient semantic information for this task.

These points from the document show that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings is effective in modeling semantics for word-alignment tasks.

: The document mentions incorporating phrase-based word embedding for improved vocabulary mapping and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for generating more accurate target code for each line in the future.
: The document states that the CNN model outperformed autoencoders and MLP with the highest achieved accuracy of 82.6%. Therefore, the CNN model performed better.
: I don't know. The document does not specify whether the results are reported only on English data.
: The document does not specify whether the results are reported only on English data. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
: The source of the OpenIE extractions was a corpus consisting of domain-targeted 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages, used by BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining.
: The authors hypothesize that the dense approach substantially boosts the performance of the sparse approach due to its implicit handling of similar words through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. This smoothing capability reduces sparseness, which is why they recommend using the dense approach in further studies.
: Kyubyong Park's and Edouard Grave's pre-trained word embeddings were used.

: The syntactic analysis shows that the method enables control over the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as verbs and adjectives related to them. Specifically, it demonstrates an increase in the number of feminine-marked verbs when the "She said" prefix is used, bringing the proportion closer to that of the reference translation, though still under-predicting some feminine cases. For the audience, the analysis shows that adding the "to them" condition brings the proportion of plural second-person pronouns much closer to that of the reference translation, improving upon the baseline system's under-prediction of plural forms. These results indicate that the method effectively influences the NMT system to produce the desired target-side morphology when the information is not available in the source sentence.
: The document mentions two normalization techniques: cepstral mean normalization (CMN) and using deltas and delta-deltas.
: The evaluation metrics used in the document are AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) and top-1 accuracy.
: The document represents textual documents using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weights within a Vector Space Model (VSM). Each document is represented as a vector of TF-IDF weights.
: On average, there are 15 sentence transformations available per unique sentence in the dataset.
: I don't know.
: I don't know. The document does not provide information on how the proposed model differs from Generative Adversarial Networks.
: The document does not provide specific performance metrics (such as EER values) for both approaches on their respective datasets (CN-Celeb and VoxCeleb). Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."
