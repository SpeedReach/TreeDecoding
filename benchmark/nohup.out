Marketing emphasized the importance of assessing market potential, competition, and pricing strategies before finalizing the project. The team agreed to research various remote control designs, materials, and manufacturing processes to create an attractive and cost-effective product.

The Industrial Designer and User Interface were tasked with investigating shapes, colors, and design elements, while Marketing would analyze market trends and competition. The team planned to reconvene in half an hour to share their findings and further discuss the project's direction. Warnings were set up for future meetings to ensure timely progress.
: The team building process began with an introduction and icebreaker activity where team members shared their favorite animals and the characteristics they admire about them. This activity aimed to foster team bonding and encourage open communication among the members.

After the icebreaker, the Project Manager outlined the agenda for the meeting, which included discussing the project's goals, such as designing a new remote control with a selling price of €25 and a profit target of €50 million. The team also discussed the need for the remote control to be multifunctional, compatible with various devices, ergonomic, and user-friendly.

The team members then divided their responsibilities for the project. The Industrial Designer focused on the working design, ensuring the remote control's functionality and ergonomics. The User Interface (UI) Designer concentrated on the technical functionalities, making sure the remote control could operate various devices. The Marketing Specialist, Courtney, was tasked with creating the user requirements specification, defining the user's needs and expectations for the remote control.

The meeting concluded with the Project Manager summarizing the next steps and setting the date for the next meeting. The team members were reminded of their individual responsibilities and the importance of effective communication and collaboration throughout the project.

Overall, the team building process was successful in establishing a clear understanding of the project's objectives, dividing responsibilities, and fostering a collaborative environment among the team members. The icebreaker activity helped create a positive atmosphere and encouraged team members to share their ideas and perspectives, which will be beneficial for the project's success.
: The team discussed their favorite animals during a meeting about designing a new remote control product. Marketing mentioned being allergic to cats, which sparked a conversation among the team members about their own allergies or preferences related to cats. This light-hearted moment briefly interrupted the more serious discussion about the project's goals, such as the selling price, profit aim, production cost, and the need for a multifunctional remote control that is ergonomic, user-friendly, and compatible with various devices. The team also touched upon the importance of battery type and size for the remote control's design. The meeting concluded with the assignment of specific tasks to each team member, including the Industrial Designer focusing on the working design, the User Interface person working on the technical functions design, and the Marketing person handling the user requirements specification.
