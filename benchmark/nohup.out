: The seed lexicon is a collection of positive and negative predicates used to assign polarity scores to events. It consists of 15 positive words and 15 negative words, such as "喜ぶ" (rejoice), "嬉しい" (be glad), "幸せ" (be happy), and "怒る" (get angry), "悲しい" (be sad), "寂しい" (be lonely), "怖い" (be scared), "不安" (feel anxious), "恥ずかしい" (be embarrassed), "嫌" (hate), "落ち込む" (feel down), "退屈" (be bored), "絶望" (feel hopeless), "辛い" (have a hard time), "困る" (have trouble), "憂鬱" (be depressed), "心配" (be worried), and "情けない" (be sorry). These words are used to automatically assign polarity scores (+1 for positive events and -1 for negative events) to event pairs extracted from a large raw corpus. The seed lexicon helps the model learn complex phenomena like negation through label propagation.

: The quality of UniSent is measured by comparing it with manually created sentiment lexicons in various languages and domains. The comparison results are presented in Table TABREF13 for general domain data and Table TABREF14 for Twitter domain data. The performance of UniSent is evaluated based on its ability to outperform a baseline lexicon and its closeness to the manually annotated gold standard lexicons. The results show that UniSent outperforms the baseline for all languages and its quality is close to manually annotated data. Additionally, the domain adaptation technique brings small improvements for morphologically poor languages.

: Traditional methods for identifying important attributes in knowledge graphs typically involve post-processing steps after automated attribute-value extraction. These methods include:

1. Extracting potential class-attribute pairs using linguistically motivated patterns from unstructured text, such as query logs and query sessions, and then scoring the attributes using models like the Bayes model (BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2).

2. Identifying product attributes from customer online reviews using part-of-speech (POS) tagging patterns and evaluating their importance with frequency metrics (BIBREF3).

3. Developing systems to extract concept-attribute pairs from multiple data sources, such as Probase, general web documents, query logs, and external knowledge bases, and aggregating weights into a consistent typicality score using a Ranking SVM model (BIBREF4).

4. Using algorithms like OntoRank to rank the importance of semantic web objects at different levels of granularity (BIBREF5).

5. Adapting PageRank/HITS algorithms to semantic web data to rank entities based on property values (BIBREF6).

6. Ranking semantic web resources based on importance, relevance, and query length, and aggregating features with an overall ranking model (BIBREF7).

7. Collecting attributes from different sources and sorting them by popularity based on their co-occurrences in the dataset (BIBREF9).

8. Using structured knowledge bases to compute intermediate features, including the importance or popularity of each entity type, IDF computation for each attribute globally, and IDF computation for entity types, to train a classifier (BIBREF10).

9. Extracting features from external data sources like GoogleSuggestChars and using them for attribute ranking (BIBREF11).

10. Utilizing semantic information about entities and information from top-ranked documents from a general search engine to identify important attributes (BIBREF12).

Most of these traditional methods suffer from issues such as poor quality of pattern rules and reliance on exact string matching, which can be ineffective due to the presence of misspellings or synonyms in natural language queries. The proposed method in the document aims to address these limitations by using external user-generated data and state-of-the-art word/sub-word embedding techniques for semantic matching.

: The study found that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable development (Topic 7) in their annual UN General Debate statements varies considerably according to country-specific factors such as wealth, population, democracy, levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA), and conflict. There are significant fluctuations in the relationship between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development. For instance, highly autocratic states tend to discuss sustainable development more than slightly less autocratic states, possibly to divert attention from democracy and human rights issues. Countries experiencing conflict are less likely to discuss sustainable development, as they are more likely to focus on conflict and security issues. There are also regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing sustainable development the most, while countries in North America discuss it the least. The relationships between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development require further analysis and exploration. The study does not find a significant impact of wealth, population, democracy, levels of ODA, and conflict on the discussion of Topic 2 (economic development). However, there are regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing economic development the most, and countries in North America discussing it the least.

: The authors present several experiments to validate their QnAMaker system:

1. Performance evaluation across various domains: The authors measure the system's performance by using managed judges who understand the knowledge base to judge user queries' relevance to the QA pairs (binary labels). They filter out data for which judges do not agree on the label and evaluate performance on given KB both with and without chit-chat data, as well as performance on just chit-chat data.

2. Percentage of knowledge bases using pre-built persona-based chit-chat: The authors report that around 27% of the knowledge bases created use pre-built persona-based chit-chat, out of which, approximately 4% of the knowledge bases are created for chit-chat alone. The highest used personality is Professional, which is used in 9% of the knowledge bases.

3. Percentage of developers enabling active learning suggestions: The authors mention that around 25.5% of the knowledge bases use one URL as a source during creation, and 25% of the developers have enabled active learning suggestions. The acceptance to reject ratio for active learning suggestions is 0.31.

4. Sources used for knowledge base creation: The authors report that 25.5% of the knowledge bases use one URL as a source during creation, approximately 41% of the knowledge bases use different sources like multiple URLs, and 15.19% of the knowledge bases use both URL and editorial content as sources. The rest use just editorial content.

These experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the QnAMaker system in creating intelligent bots, handling chit-chat, active learning, and multi-turn conversations.

: The document does not provide specific details on how robustness is measured in the experiments. Robustness in machine learning typically refers to the ability of a model to maintain its performance when faced with variations or perturbations in the input data, such as noise, changes in data distribution, or adversarial attacks.

To measure robustness, researchers might consider the following approaches:

1. **Noise Injection**: Adding random noise to the input data and evaluating if the model's performance degrades significantly.

2. **Data Distribution Shift**: Testing the model on data that has a different distribution from the training set to see if it still performs well.

3. **Adversarial Attacks**: Introducing small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data to try and fool the model into making incorrect predictions.

4. **Cross-Validation**: Using different subsets of the data for training and testing to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across various data samples.

5. **Ablation Studies**: Removing or altering certain features or components of the model to understand their impact on the model's robustness.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the performance of the model against other models or baselines under the same robustness-testing conditions.

Since the document does not explicitly mention any of these methods, it is not possible to determine the exact approach used to measure robustness in the experiments without additional information.

: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool, even when provided with a large parallel corpus. This suggests that word-level semantics are well captured by mBERT contextual embeddings.

2. An explicitly learned projection of the representations leads to a significant improvement in word-alignment performance, reaching close-to-perfect accuracy. This indicates that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings is capable of capturing semantic correspondences between languages.

3. The adversarial fine-tuning experiment, which aimed to remove language identity information from the representations, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the accuracy of the language identification classifier. However, other tasks, such as word-alignment, were not affected by this adversarial fine-tuning.

These points collectively suggest that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is capable of modeling semantics in a way that allows for high-accuracy word-alignment between languages.

: The document does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics for their system. However, it mentions that their end-to-end empathetic chatbot, CAiRE, was able to support more than 50 concurrent requests during a stress test using 8 GPUs, with each GTX 1080Ti running two independent processes achieving around 90% GPU utilization. Additionally, after incorporating ethical values into CAiRE and using active learning based on user feedback, the system was able to greatly reduce unethical responses. However, without specific performance metrics such as accuracy, response time, or user satisfaction scores, it's not possible to provide a detailed assessment of the system's performance.

: Yes, the document discusses the use of the state-of-the-art model, specifically the ESIM model, to analyze the attention mechanism in the context of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. The authors focus on interpreting the gating and attention signals of the intermediate layers of deep models like ESIM to understand the behavior of these components and their impact on the final decision. They provide an extensive analysis of the ESIM model's performance on the NLI task and demonstrate how their methods reveal insights not available from traditional methods of inspecting attention and word saliency.

: The correlation results for Sum-QE with human judgments are high or very high for all linguistic qualities (denoted as $\mathcal {Q}$s) in all datasets, except for $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, where the correlation is only moderate. The specific correlation values (Spearman's $\rho$, Kendall's $\tau$, and Pearson's $r$) are not provided in the text. However, it is mentioned that the BERT multi-task versions perform better with highly correlated qualities like $\mathcal {Q}4$ and $\mathcal {Q}5$. The BERT-based models achieve a moderate positive correlation for $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, while BEST-ROUGE has a negative correlation for the same quality due to its inability to account for repetitions. The BiGRU-based models also reach their lowest performance on $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, potentially due to less effective capture of long-distance relations compared to BERT.

: No, the document does not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. However, it does mention the use of Google's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) Large, which is trained on the CommonCrawl dataset of approximately 840 billion tokens. CommonCrawl is a non-profit organization that crawls the web in multiple languages, so it can be inferred that the data used for training the embeddings likely includes multilingual content. Nevertheless, the document does not provide a detailed breakdown of the languages represented in the dataset used for the embeddings.

: Yes, the authors hypothesize that the dense approach substantially boosts the performance of the sparse approach due to its implicit handling of similar words through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. This smoothing capability reduces sparseness, which is why they recommend using the dense approach in further studies.

: The word embeddings used were created by Kyubyong Park and Edouard Grave. Park used fastText and word2vec methods to generate embeddings from the Wikipedia database backup dumps, resulting in a 100-dimensional vector with about 10k words. Grave and his team used the fastText tool to generate embeddings, which resulted in a 300-dimensional vector with approximately 200k words.

: Yes, the document suggests that CTC can be used to pretrain the RNN encoder to speed up the training of the joint CTC and SCRF model. This approach is analogous to sequence training of HMM acoustic models, where the network is usually pretrained by the frame-level cross-entropy (CE) criterion. The experiments showed that pretraining indeed improves the convergence speed of the joint model.

: The syntactic analysis in the document demonstrates that the proposed method effectively controls the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as verbs and adjectives related to them, in the target language translations. Here are the key conclusions from the syntactic analysis:

1. Speaker's Gender Effects: The analysis shows that the injected prefixes ("He said", "I said", "She said") significantly influence the gender of the verbs associated with the first-person singular pronouns. The baseline system under-predicts the feminine form of verbs, but the "She said" prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion much closer to that of the reference translation.

2. Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: The analysis reveals that the injected prefixes ("to them", "to him/her", "to her/them") affect the gender and number of second-person pronouns in the target language translations. The baseline system severely under the to them, but the "to them" and "to her/them" prefixes bring the proportion of singular and plural second-person pronouns much closer to that of the reference translation.

In summary, the syntactic analysis confirms that the proposed.

: The representations for textual documents used in this research are vector space models (VSMs) with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights. In a VSM, each document is represented as a vector of TF-IDF values, where each term in the document corresponds to a dimension in the vector space. The TF-IDF weight measures the importance or uniqueness of a term within a set of documents, taking into account both the frequency of the term in a single document (Term Frequency) and its rarity across all documents (Inverse Document Frequency). This representation allows for the computation of similarity between documents using various similarity measures.

: On the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus (STS Corpus), the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.63%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model reported by BIBREF5.

For the Sanders dataset, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14) that used an ensemble of multiple base classifiers.

In the Health Care Reform (HCR) dataset, the proposed model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14), achieving better results in sentiment classification.

Overall, the proposed model demonstrated superior performance on all three datasets when compared to the state-of-the-art models and other approaches.

: The model described in the document, NetAb, differs from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in its approach and structure. NetAb uses two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle noisy labels during training for sentence-level sentiment classification (SSC). One CNN, called the A-network, predicts 'clean' sentiment labels, while the other, the Ab-network, estimates a noise transition matrix to manage input noisy labels. The networks are trained alternately using their respective loss functions.

On the other hand, GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator creates synthetic data samples, and the discriminator evaluates them against real data samples. The goal is for the generator to produce data indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator aims to accurately classify real and generated samples.

In summary, while both NetAb and GANs involve training neural networks, NetAb specifically focuses on handling noisy labels in sentiment classification tasks, whereas GANs are designed for generating new data samples that mimic a given data distribution. The architectures and training objectives of these two models are fundamentally different.

: The seed lexicon is a collection consisting of 15 positive words and 15 negative words. These words are used to assign polarity scores to events. Positive events are given a score of +1, and negative events are given a score of -1. The seed lexicon is used to automatically extract discourse-tagged event pairs from a large raw corpus, which are then utilized for training the neural network models to predict the sentiment polarity of affective events.

: Traditional methods for identifying important attributes in knowledge graphs typically involve post-processing steps after automated attribute-value extraction. Some of these methods include:

1. BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, and BIBREF4: These approaches extract potential class-attribute pairs using linguistically motivated patterns from unstructured text, such as query logs and query sessions, and then score the attributes using models like the Bayes model.

2. BIBREF3: Rahul Rai's method involves identifying product attributes from customer online reviews using part-of-speech (POS) tagging patterns and evaluating their importance with various frequency metrics.

3. BIBREF4: Lee et al. developed a system to extract concept-attribute pairs from multiple data sources, including Probase, general web documents, query logs, and external knowledge bases. They aggregate weights from different sources into a consistent typicality score using a Ranking SVM model.

4. BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, and BIBREF8: These works focus on ranking entities, sorting semantic web resources based on importance, relevance, and query length, and aggregating features with an overall ranking model.

5. BIBREF9 and BIBREF10: These approaches involve collecting attributes from different sources and sorting them by popularity based on their co-occurrences in the dataset or using structured knowledge base features to train a classifier.

6. BIBREF11: Similar to BIBREF10, this method uses additional features extracted from data sources like GoogleSuggestChars.

These methods often rely on pattern rules and ranking processes to identify more precise attributes from candidates, but they may suffer from poor quality of pattern rules and the need for exact string matching, which can be ineffective due to misspellings or synonyms in natural language queries.

: The study found that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable development (Topic 7) in their annual UN General Debate statements varies considerably according to country-specific factors such as wealth, population, democracy, levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA), and conflict. There are significant fluctuations in the relationship between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development. For instance, the most autocratic states tend to discuss sustainable development more than slightly less autocratic states, possibly to divert attention from democracy and human rights issues. Additionally, countries experiencing conflict are less likely to discuss sustainable development than those not in conflict, likely because they focus more on conflict and security issues. There are also regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing sustainable development the most, while North American countries discuss it the least. However, the relationships between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development require further analysis and exploration. The study also found that discussion of economic development (Topic 2) is not significantly impacted by these country-specific factors, although there are regional effects.

: The authors present several experiments to validate their QnAMaker system:

1. Performance evaluation across various domains: They measure the system's performance on datasets from different domains, using managed judges who understand the knowledge base to judge the relevance of user queries to the QA pairs. They filter out data for which judges do not agree on the label.

2. Evaluation with and without chit-chat data: They compare the performance of the system on given KBs both with and without chit-chat data, as well as performance on just chit-chat data.

3. Active learning acceptance rate: They observe that around 25.5% of the knowledge bases created use one URL as a source, while 41% use different sources like multiple URLs. They also track the acceptance rate for active learning suggestions, which is 0.31.

4. Personality-based chit-chat usage: They report that around 27% of the knowledge bases created use pre-built persona-based chit-chat, with the highest used personality being Professional (used in 9% of the knowledge bases).

These experiments help demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the QnAMaker system in handling various types of data and user interactions.

: The document does not provide specific details on how robustness is measured in the experiments. Robustness in machine learning typically refers to the ability of a model to maintain its performance when faced with variations or perturbations in the input data, such as noise, outliers, or changes in the data distribution.

To measure robustness, researchers might consider the following approaches:

1. **Noise Injection**: Adding noise to the input data (e.g., synonyms, misspellings, or random insertions/deletions) and evaluating the model's performance on the perturbed data.

2. **Adversarial Examples**: Creating examples specifically designed to challenge the model by exploiting its weaknesses. The model's performance on these adversarial examples can indicate its robustness.

3. **Data Distribution Shifts**: Testing the model on data that has a different distribution from the training set. This could involve using data from different time periods, domains, or sources.

4. **Cross-Validation**: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

5. **Ablation Studies**: Removing or altering certain features or components of the model to understand their impact on performance and robustness.

6. **Comparison with Baselines**: Comparing the model's performance against other models or baselines under various conditions to assess relative robustness.

In the context of the provided document, if robustness were to be measured, it would likely involve comparing the performance of the Plackett-Luce models (PL($k$)) against other models like MERT and MIRA under different conditions, such as varying feature richness or different sizes of N-best lists. However, specific details on the robustness evaluation methods used in the experiments are not provided in the text.

input length:  3082
: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool, even when provided with a large parallel corpus. This suggests that word-level semantics are well captured by mBERT contextual embeddings.

2. Learning an explicit projection of the representations had a negligible effect on the performance of the word-alignment task. This indicates that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings already contains sufficient semantic information for accurate word-level alignment.

3. The adversarial fine-tuning experiment, which aimed to remove language identity information from the representations, did not affect the performance of the word-alignment task. This further supports the idea that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings is capable of capturing semantic information necessary for accurate word-level alignment.

In summary, the document shows that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is capable of capturing semantic information at the word level, allowing for high-accuracy word-alignment tasks. This demonstrates the generality of the language-neutral component in modeling semantics.

: Yes, the document discusses the use of the state-of-the-art model, specifically the ESIM (Enhanced Sequential Inference Model), to analyze the attention mechanism in the context of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. The ESIM model is chosen for its complex neural architectures involving key mechanisms such as attention and repeated reading, which are seen in successful models for other NLP tasks. The authors provide an extensive analysis of the ESIM model's behavior, particularly focusing on the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals to understand the model's decision-making process.

: The correlation results for Sum-QE with human judgments are high or very high for all linguistic qualities (denoted as $\mathcal {Q}$s) in all datasets, except for $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, where it is only moderate. The specific correlation values are not provided in the text. However, it is mentioned that Sum-QE achieves high correlations with human scores for most linguistic qualities rated on three different datasets (DUC-05, DUC-06, and DUC-07).

For a more detailed understanding of the correlation results, Table TABREF23 in the document would need to be referred to, as it presumably contains the specific correlation values (Spearman's $\rho$, Kendall's $\tau$, and Pearson's $r$) for all datasets and models.

: Yes, the authors hypothesize that the dense approach substantially boosts the performance of the sparse approach due to its implicit handling of similar words. This is achieved through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. The smoothing capabilities of the dense approach, which reduce sparseness, are suggested as a reason for its superior performance. The authors recommend using the dense approach in further studies because of these advantages.

: Yes, the document suggests that CTC can be used to pretrain the RNN encoder to speed up the training of the joint CTC and SCRF model. This approach is analogous to sequence training of HMM acoustic models, where the network is usually pretrained by the frame-level cross-entropy (CE) criterion. The experiments showed that pretraining indeed improves the convergence speed of the joint model.

: The syntactic analysis demonstrates that the proposed method effectively controls the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as verbs and adjectives related to them, in the target language translations. Here are the key conclusions from the analysis:

1. Speaker's Gender Effects: The analysis shows that the injected prefixes ("He said", "I said", "She said") significantly influence the gender of the verbs associated with the first-person singular pronouns. The baseline system under-predicts the feminine form of verbs, while the "She said" prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion closer to the reference translation.

2. Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: The analysis reveals that the injected prefixes ("to them", "to him/her", "to her/them") affect the gender and number of second-person pronouns in the target language translations. The baseline system severely under-predicts the plural forms, while adding the "to them" prefix brings the proportion much closer to the reference translation.

In summary, the syntactic analysis confirms that the proposed black-box method successfully influences the morphological decisions made by the NMT system, resulting in translations that accurately reflect the desired gender and number properties of the speaker and audience.

: The evaluation metrics used in the study include:

1. AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): This metric is used to evaluate the performance of the ranking models. It measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative instances.

2. Overall Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances (both positive and negative) among all instances.

3. Top-1 Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of instances where the model correctly ranks the most relevant joke at the top of the ranked list.

4. User Interruption Rate: This metric measures the rate at which users interrupt the VVA's joke experience. A lower interruption rate indicates higher user satisfaction.

5. Reuse of VVA Skills: This metric measures the frequency with which users reuse the VVA's joke skill. A higher reuse rate indicates higher user satisfaction.

6. Number of Active Dialogs: This metric measures the number of ongoing conversations between users and the VVA. A higher number of active dialogs indicates higher user engagement and satisfaction.

These metrics were used to compare the performance of different models and labeling strategies, and to assess their impact on user satisfaction.

: The representations for textual documents used in this research are vector space models (VSMs) with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights. In a VSM, each document is represented as a vector of TF-IDF values, where each term in the document corresponds to a dimension in the vector space. The TF-IDF weight measures the importance or uniqueness of a term within a set of documents, taking into account both the frequency of the term in a single document and its rarity across all documents. This representation allows for the computation of similarity between documents using various similarity measures.

: On the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus (STS Corpus), the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.63%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model reported by BIBREF5.

For the Sanders dataset, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14) that used an ensemble of multiple base classifiers.

In the Health Care Reform (HCR) dataset, the proposed model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14), achieving better results in sentiment classification.

Overall, the proposed model demonstrated superior performance on all three datasets when compared to the state-of-the-art models and other approaches.

: The model described in the document, NetAb, differs from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in its approach and structure. NetAb uses two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle noisy labels during training for sentence-level sentiment classification (SSC). One CNN, called the A-network, predicts 'clean' sentiment labels, while the other, the Ab-network, estimates a noise transition matrix to manage input noisy labels. The networks are trained alternately using their respective loss functions.

On the other hand, GANs consist of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity, trying to distinguish between real and generated samples. The two networks compete against each other, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic samples and the discriminator improving its ability to detect them. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces samples indistinguishable from the real ones to the discriminator.

In summary, NetAb focuses on handling noisy labels in training data for SSC using two CNNs and an alternating training strategy, while GANs involve an adversarial process between a generator and a discriminator to create realistic synthetic data. The two models have different architectures, objectives, and applications.

: The seed lexicon is a collection of positive and negative predicates used to assign polarity scores to events. It consists of 15 positive words and 15 negative words, such as "喜ぶ" (rejoice), "嬉しい" (be glad), "幸せ" (be happy), and "怒る" (get angry), "悲しい" (be sad), "寂しい" (be lonely), "怖い" (be scared), "不安" (feel anxious), "恥ずかしい" (be embarrassed), "嫌" (hate), "落ち込む" (feel down), "退屈" (be bored), "絶望" (feel hopeless), "辛い" (have a hard time), "困る" (have trouble), "憂鬱" (be depressed), "心配" (be worried), and "情けない" (be sorry). These words are used to automatically assign polarity scores (+1 for positive events and -1 for negative events) during the training process.

: The document compares the results of the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique applied to a sequence-to-sequence model trained for abstractive text summarization with the baseline model from See et al. See2017, which was also trained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The baseline model used in See et al. See2017 is a deep sequence-to-sequence encoder/decoder model with attention, consisting of a bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cell for the encoder and a single LSTM cell with attention mechanism for the decoder.

: The document does not provide specific information on whether experiments were conducted using the CORD-19-NER dataset. It mainly describes the creation, structure, and annotation process of the dataset, as well as its potential applications for text mining and COVID-19 studies.
: The quality of UniSent is measured by comparing it with manually created sentiment lexicons in various languages and domains. The comparison results are presented in Table TABREF13 for general domain data and Table TABREF14 for Twitter domain data. The performance of UniSent is evaluated based on its ability to outperform a baseline lexicon and its closeness to the manually annotated gold standard lexicons. The results show that UniSent outperforms the baseline for all languages and its quality is close to manually annotated data. Additionally, the domain adaptation technique brings small improvements for morphologically poor languages.
: The sample size used to measure user satisfaction in the study was 34,432 user conversations.
: The document does not explicitly state that the authors only report on English. The dataset mentioned, Wiki Neutrality Corpus (WNC), consists of Wikipedia revisions marked by editors over a period of 15 years, but the language of the revisions is not specified in the provided text. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be determined whether the study is limited to English or includes multiple languages. If the language is not specified elsewhere in the document, one would have to say "I don't know."
: The algorithm used for the classification tasks is the Random Forest Ensemble classifier.
: Traditional methods for identifying important attributes in knowledge graphs typically involve post-processing steps after automated attribute-value extraction. These methods include:

1. Extracting potential class-attribute pairs using linguistically motivated patterns from unstructured text, such as query logs and query sessions, and then scoring the attributes using models like the Bayes model (BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2).

2. Identifying product attributes from customer online reviews using part-of-speech (POS) tagging patterns and evaluating their importance with frequency metrics (BIBREF3).

3. Developing systems to extract concept-attribute pairs from multiple data sources, such as Probase, general web documents, query logs, and external knowledge bases, and aggregating weights into a consistent typicality score using a Ranking SVM model (BIBREF4).

4. Using algorithms like OntoRank to rank the importance of semantic web objects at different levels of granularity (BIBREF5).

5. Adapting PageRank/HITS algorithms to semantic web data to rank entities based on property values (BIBREF6).

6. Ranking semantic web resources based on importance, relevance, and query length, and aggregating features with an overall ranking model (BIBREF7).

7. Collecting attributes from different sources and sorting them by popularity based on their co-occurrences in the dataset (BIBREF9).

8. Using structured knowledge bases to compute intermediate features, including the importance or popularity of each entity type, IDF computation for each attribute globally, and IDF computation for entity types, to train a classifier (BIBREF10).

9. Extracting features from external data sources like GoogleSuggestChars and using them for attribute ranking (BIBREF11).

10. Utilizing semantic information about entities and information from top-ranked documents from a general search engine to identify important attributes (BIBREF12).

Most of these traditional methods suffer from issues such as poor quality of pattern rules and reliance on exact string matching, which can be ineffective due to the presence of misspellings or synonyms in natural language queries. The proposed method in the document aims to address these limitations by using external user-generated data and state-of-the-art word/sub-word embedding techniques for semantic matching.
: The study found that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable development (Topic 7) in their annual UN General Debate statements varies considerably according to country-specific factors such as wealth, population, democracy, levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA), and conflict. There are significant fluctuations in the relationship between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development. For instance, highly autocratic states tend to discuss sustainable development more than slightly less autocratic states, possibly to divert attention from democracy and human rights issues. Countries experiencing conflict are less likely to discuss sustainable development, as they are more likely to focus on conflict and security issues. There are also regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing sustainable development the most, while countries in North America discuss it the least. The relationships between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development require further analysis and exploration. The study does not find a significant impact of wealth, population, democracy, levels of ODA, and conflict on the discussion of Topic 2 (economic development). However, there are regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing economic development the most, and countries in North America discussing it the least.
: The authors present several experiments to validate their QnAMaker system:

1. Performance evaluation across various domains: The authors measure the system's performance by using managed judges who understand the knowledge base to judge user queries' relevance to the QA pairs (binary labels). They filter out data for which judges do not agree on the label and evaluate performance on given KB both with and without chit-chat data, as well as performance on just chit-chat data.

2. Percentage of knowledge bases using pre-built persona-based chit-chat: The authors report that around 27% of the knowledge bases created use pre-built persona-based chit-chat, out of which, approximately 4% of the knowledge bases are created for chit-chat alone. The highest used personality is Professional, which is used in 9% of the knowledge bases.

3. Percentage of developers enabling active learning suggestions: The authors mention that around 25.5% of the knowledge bases use one URL as a source during creation, and 25% of the developers have enabled active learning suggestions. The acceptance to reject ratio for active learning suggestions is 0.31.

4. Sources used for knowledge base creation: The authors report that 25.5% of the knowledge bases use one URL as a source during creation, approximately 41% of the knowledge bases use different sources like multiple URLs, and 15.19% of the knowledge bases use both URL and editorial content as sources. The rest use just editorial content.

These experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the QnAMaker system in creating intelligent bots, handling chit-chat, active learning, and multi-turn conversations.
: The document does not provide specific details on how robustness is measured in the experiments. Robustness in machine learning typically refers to the ability of a model to maintain its performance when faced with variations or perturbations in the input data, such as noise, changes in data distribution, or adversarial attacks.

To measure robustness, researchers might consider the following approaches:

1. **Noise Injection**: Adding random noise to the input data and evaluating if the model's performance degrades significantly.

2. **Data Distribution Shift**: Testing the model on data that has a different distribution from the training set to see if it still performs well.

3. **Adversarial Attacks**: Introducing small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data to try and fool the model into making incorrect predictions.

4. **Cross-Validation**: Using different subsets of the data for training and testing to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across various data samples.

5. **Ablation Studies**: Removing or altering certain features or components of the model to understand their impact on the model's robustness.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the performance of the model against other models or baselines under the same robustness-testing conditions.

Since the document does not explicitly mention any of these methods, it is not possible to determine the exact approach used to measure robustness in the experiments without additional information.

: Yes, the semantic hierarchy representation generated by the discourse-aware syntactic text simplification (TS) approach is used to facilitate and improve a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. These tasks include Machine Translation, Information Extraction (IE), Text Summarization, and Open Information Extraction (Open IE). The semantic hierarchy helps in enriching the output of these tasks with contextual information, improving their accuracy and interpretability.
: The document does not provide specific information on how the author's work ranked among other submissions on the BioASQ challenge. It discusses the methods, experiments, and results of the author's participation, but does not mention a ranking or comparison with other submissions.
: The German-English dataset used in the study consisted of 159,000 parallel sentences for training, 1,000 for development, and 2,000 for testing. Additionally, a Korean-English dataset was used with around 90,000 parallel sentences for training, 1,000 for development, and 2,000 for testing.
: The previous work's model mentioned in the document is a Ternary Trans-CNN model proposed by Mathur et al. This model architecture comprises of 3 layers of Convolution 1D with filter sizes of 15, 12, and 10 and kernel size of 3, followed by 2 dense fully connected layers of size 64 and 3. The first dense fully connected layer has ReLU activation, while the last Dense layer has Softmax activation. This model was trained on a parallel English dataset provided by Davidson et al. and achieved an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 80.2%, and recall of 69.8%.
: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool, even when provided with a large parallel corpus. This suggests that word-level semantics are well captured by mBERT contextual embeddings.

2. An explicitly learned projection of the representations leads to a significant improvement in word-alignment performance, reaching close-to-perfect accuracy. This indicates that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings is capable of capturing semantic correspondences between languages.

3. The adversarial fine-tuning experiment, which aimed to remove language identity information from the representations, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the accuracy of the language identification classifier. However, other tasks, such as word-alignment, were not affected by this adversarial fine-tuning.

These points collectively suggest that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is capable of modeling semantics in a way that allows for high-accuracy word-alignment between languages.
: The document does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics for their system. However, it mentions that their end-to-end empathetic chatbot, CAiRE, was able to support more than 50 concurrent requests during a stress test using 8 GPUs, with each GTX 1080Ti running two independent processes achieving around 90% GPU utilization. Additionally, after incorporating ethical values into CAiRE and using active learning based on user feedback, the system was able to greatly reduce unethical responses. However, without specific performance metrics such as accuracy, response time, or user satisfaction scores, it's not possible to provide a detailed answer on the system's performance.

: Yes, the document discusses the use of the state-of-the-art model, specifically the ESIM model, to analyze the attention mechanism in the context of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. The authors focus on interpreting the gating and attention signals of the intermediate layers of deep models like ESIM to understand the behavior of these components and their impact on the final decision. They provide an extensive analysis of the ESIM model's performance on the NLI task and demonstrate how their methods reveal insights not available from traditional methods of inspecting attention and word saliency.
: The correlation results for Sum-QE with human judgments are high or very high for all linguistic qualities (denoted as $\mathcal {Q}$s) in all datasets, except for $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, where the correlation is only moderate. The specific correlation values (Spearman's $\rho$, Kendall's $\tau$, and Pearson's $r$) are not provided in the text. However, it is mentioned that the BERT multi-task versions perform better with highly correlated qualities like $\mathcal {Q}4$ and $\mathcal {Q}5$. The BERT-based models achieve a moderate positive correlation for $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, while BEST-ROUGE has a negative correlation for the same quality due to its inability to account for repetitions. The BiGRU-based models also reach their lowest performance on $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, potentially due to less effective capture of long-distance relations compared to BERT.
: The paper discusses incorporating phrase-based word embedding for improved vocabulary mapping and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for generating more accurate target code for each line. These techniques aim to enhance the machine learning model's ability to convert human expressions into coding expressions, potentially leading to a unified programming interface in the future.
: The deep learning model that performed better in this study was the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental results showed that CNNs outperformed both the deep autoencoders and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, achieving the highest accuracy of 82.6%.
: No, the document does not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. However, it does mention the use of Google's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) Large, which is trained on the CommonCrawl dataset of approximately 840 billion tokens. CommonCrawl is a non-profit organization that crawls the web in multiple languages, so it can be inferred that the data used for training the embeddings likely includes multilingual content. Nevertheless, the document does not provide a detailed breakdown of the languages represented in the dataset used for the embeddings.
: No, the document does not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. However, it does mention that the tweets are downloaded using the Twitter API, which suggests that the data used for the study is likely in English, as Twitter is predominantly an English-speaking platform. The document does not provide information about the use of data in other languages.
: The source of the OpenIE extractions was the text corpora (S) from BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining, which consisted of 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages.
: Yes, the authors hypothesize that the dense approach substantially boosts the performance of the sparse approach due to its implicit handling of similar words through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. This smoothing capability reduces sparseness, which is why they recommend using the dense approach in further studies.
: The word embeddings used were created by Kyubyong Park and Edouard Grave. Park used fastText and word2vec methods to generate embeddings from the Wikipedia database backup dumps, resulting in a 100-dimensional vector with about 10k words. Grave and his team used the fastText tool to generate embeddings, which resulted in a 300-dimensional vector with approximately 200k words.
: The supplemental tasks used for multitask learning in the document are predicting the relationships of the three pairs: (oriQ/relQ), (oriQ/relC), and (relQ/relC). These tasks involve classifying whether the relationship between the original question (oriQ) and the related question (relQ), the original question (oriQ) and the external comment (relC), and the related question (relQ) and the external comment (relC) is relevant or irrelevant.
: Yes, they use multi-attention heads. Specifically, they use Multi-Head Attention (MHA) for both introspective context words modeling (Intra-MHA) and context-perceptive target words modeling (Inter-MHA), performing multiple attention functions in parallel.
: The document does not specify the names of the datasets used. It only mentions that JESSI was trained using only the datasets given on the SemEval 2019 Task 9: Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and Forums, without using any additional external data.
: The worst performer among the tested techniques was the Classification with Depeche++ Emotion lexicons BIBREF12 + Linear SVM (Depeche + SVM) benchmark. It achieved a lower micro-F1 score compared to the other methods.
: Yes, the document suggests that CTC can be used to pretrain the RNN encoder to speed up the training of the joint CTC and SCRF model. This approach is analogous to sequence training of HMM acoustic models, where the network is usually pretrained by the frame-level cross-entropy (CE) criterion. The experiments showed that pretraining indeed improves the convergence speed of the joint model.
: The syntactic analysis in the document demonstrates that the proposed method effectively controls the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as verbs and adjectives related to them, in the target language translations. Here are the key conclusions from the syntactic analysis:

1. Speaker's Gender Effects: The analysis shows that the injected prefixes ("He said", "I said", "She said") significantly influence the gender of the verbs associated with the first-person singular pronouns. The baseline system under-predicts the feminine form of verbs, while the "She said" prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion much closer to that of the reference translation.

2. Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: The analysis reveals that the injected prefixes ("to them", "to him/her", "to her/them") affect the gender and number of second-person pronouns in the target language translations. The baseline system severely under-predicts the plural forms, while adding the "to them" condition brings the proportion much closer to that of the reference translation.

In summary, the syntactic analysis confirms that the proposed black-box method is effective in controlling the morphological properties of the speaker and audience in the target language translations, even when such information is not available in the source language. This demonstrates the method's potential for improving the accuracy and naturalness of translations between languages with different morphological systems.

: The evaluation metrics used in the study were AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve) and overall accuracy. Additionally, top-1 accuracy was used to evaluate the ranking capabilities of the proposed methods, considering only the top-ranked joke presented to the customer.
: The representations for textual documents used in this research are vector space models (VSMs) with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights. In a VSM, each document is represented as a vector of TF-IDF values, where each term in the document corresponds to a dimension in the vector space. The TF-IDF weight measures the importance or uniqueness of a term within a set of documents, taking into account both the frequency of the term in a single document (Term Frequency) and its rarity across all documents (Inverse Document Frequency). This representation allows for the computation of similarity between documents using various similarity measures.
: On average, there are 15 sentence transformations available per unique sentence in the COSTRA 1.0 dataset.
: On the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus (STS Corpus), the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.63%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model reported by BIBREF5.

For the Sanders dataset, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14) that used an ensemble of multiple base classifiers.

In the Health Care Reform (HCR) dataset, the proposed model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14), achieving better results in sentiment classification.

Overall, the proposed model demonstrated superior performance on all three datasets when compared to the state-of-the-art models and other approaches.
: The model described in the document, NetAb, differs from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in its approach and structure. NetAb uses two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle noisy labels during training for sentence-level sentiment classification (SSC). One CNN, called the A-network, predicts 'clean' sentiment labels, while the other, the Ab-network, estimates a noise transition matrix to manage input noisy labels. The networks are trained alternately using their respective loss functions.

On the other hand, GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator creates synthetic data samples, and the discriminator evaluates them against real data samples. The goal is for the generator to produce data indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator aims to accurately classify real and generated samples.

In summary, while both NetAb and GANs involve training neural networks, NetAb specifically focuses on handling noisy labels in sentiment classification tasks, whereas GANs are designed for generating new data samples that mimic a given data distribution. The architectures and training objectives of these two models are fundamentally different.

: The seed lexicon is a collection consisting of 15 positive words and 15 negative words. These words are used to assign polarity scores to events. Positive events are given a score of +1, and negative events are given a score of -1. The seed lexicon is used to automatically extract discourse-tagged event pairs from a large raw corpus, which are then utilized for training the neural network models to predict the sentiment polarity of affective events.
err
: The document does not explicitly mention which specific baselines were compared in the text summarization task using the Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique. The only baseline mentioned is the deep sequence-to-sequence encoder/decoder model with attention, which was trained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. This model was used to generate summaries and then LRP was applied to attribute importance to the input features. The baseline model's performance was compared qualitatively to the results of See et al. See2017, but no further details on additional baselines are provided in the given text.
: The paper targets Brazilian Portuguese. It discusses the use of machine learning techniques in Brazil and specifically analyzes gender bias in Portuguese word embeddings.
err
: The document does not provide specific information on whether experiments were conducted using the CORD-19-NER dataset. It mainly describes the creation, structure, and potential uses of the dataset for named entity recognition in COVID-19 studies, as well as future plans to improve the dataset and build text mining systems based on it.
: The quality of UniSent is measured by comparing it with manually created sentiment lexicons in various languages and domains. The comparison is done using test sets, which include UniSent-Lexicon, Baseline-Lexicon, and Evaluation-Lexicon. The performance of UniSent is evaluated based on its ability to outperform the baseline lexicon and its closeness to the manually annotated gold standard lexicons for general domain data and Twitter domain data. The results are presented in Table TABREF13 and Table TABREF14, showing UniSent's performance in terms of outperforming the baseline and its quality compared to manually annotated resources.
: The sample size used to measure user satisfaction in the study was 34,432 user conversations.
: The document does not explicitly state that the research is limited to English. It mentions the use of Wikipedia revisions, which are predominantly in English, but it does not specify that the study is exclusively focused on English language data. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be conclusively determined whether the authors only report on English. If I do not know the answer, I would say "I don't know."
: The algorithm used for the classification tasks in the document is the Random Forest Ensemble classifier.
: Traditional methods for identifying important attributes in knowledge graphs typically involve post-processing steps after automated attribute-value extraction. Some of these methods include:

1. BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, and BIBREF4: These approaches extract potential class-attribute pairs using linguistically motivated patterns from unstructured text, such as query logs and query sessions, and then score the attributes using models like the Bayes model.

2. BIBREF3: Rahul Rai's method involves identifying product attributes from customer online reviews using part-of-speech (POS) tagging patterns and evaluating their importance with various frequency metrics.

3. BIBREF4: Lee et al. developed a system to extract concept-attribute pairs from multiple data sources, including Probase, general web documents, query logs, and external knowledge bases. They aggregate weights from different sources into a consistent typicality score using a Ranking SVM model.

4. BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, and BIBREF8: These works focus on ranking entities, sorting semantic web resources based on importance, relevance, and query length, and aggregating features with an overall ranking model.

5. BIBREF9 and BIBREF10: These approaches involve collecting attributes from different sources and sorting them by popularity based on their co-occurrences in the dataset or using structured knowledge base features to train a classifier.

6. BIBREF11: Similar to BIBREF10, this method uses additional features extracted from data sources like GoogleSuggestChars.

These methods often rely on pattern rules and ranking processes to identify more precise attributes from candidates, but they may suffer from poor quality of pattern rules and the need for exact string matching, which can be ineffective due to misspellings or synonyms in natural language queries.
: The study found that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable development (Topic 7) in their annual UN General Debate statements varies considerably according to country-specific factors such as wealth, population, democracy, levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA), and conflict. There are significant fluctuations in the relationship between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development. For instance, the most autocratic states tend to discuss sustainable development more than slightly less autocratic states, possibly to divert attention from democracy and human rights issues. Additionally, countries experiencing conflict are less likely to discuss sustainable development than those not in conflict, likely because they focus more on conflict and security issues. There are also regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing sustainable development the most, while North American countries discuss it the least. However, the relationships between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development require further analysis and exploration. The study also found that discussion of economic development (Topic 2) is not significantly impacted by these country-specific factors, although there are regional effects.
: The authors present several experiments to validate their QnAMaker system:

1. Performance evaluation across various domains: They measure the system's performance on datasets from different domains, using managed judges who understand the knowledge base to judge the relevance of user queries to the QA pairs. They filter out data for which judges do not agree on the label.

2. Evaluation with and without chit-chat data: They compare the performance of the system on given KBs both with and without chit-chat data, as well as performance on just chit-chat data.

3. Active learning acceptance rate: They observe that around 25.5% of the knowledge bases created use one URL as a source, while 41% use different sources like multiple URLs. They also track the acceptance rate for active learning suggestions, which is 0.31.

4. Personality-based chit-chat usage: They report that around 27% of the knowledge bases created use pre-built persona-based chit-chat, with the highest used personality being Professional (used in 9% of the knowledge bases).

These experiments help demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the QnAMaker system in handling various types of data and user interactions.
: The document does not provide specific details on how robustness is measured in the experiments. Robustness in machine learning typically refers to the ability of a model to maintain its performance when faced with variations or perturbations in the input data, such as noise, outliers, or changes in the data distribution.

To measure robustness, researchers might consider the following approaches:

1. **Noise Injection**: Adding noise to the input data (e.g., synonyms, misspellings, or random insertions/deletions) and evaluating the model's performance on the perturbed data.

2. **Adversarial Examples**: Creating examples specifically designed to challenge the model by exploiting its weaknesses. The model's performance on these adversarial examples can indicate its robustness.

3. **Data Distribution Shifts**: Testing the model on data that has a different distribution from the training set. This could involve using data from different time periods, domains, or sources.

4. **Cross-Validation**: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

5. **Ablation Studies**: Removing or altering certain features or components of the model to understand their impact on performance and robustness.

6. **Comparison with Baselines**: Comparing the model's performance against other models or baselines under various conditions to assess relative robustness.

In the context of the provided document, if robustness were to be measured, it would likely involve comparing the performance of the Plackett-Luce models (PL($k$)) against other models like MERT and MIRA under different conditions, such as varying feature richness or different sizes of N-best lists. However, specific details on the robustness evaluation methods used in the experiments are not provided in the text.
: The document does not explicitly mention the specific ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system(s) used in the work. It discusses the use of $n$-best hypotheses generated by an ASR module but does not provide details on the particular ASR technology or system employed.
: Yes, the semantic hierarchy representation generated by the discourse-aware syntactic text simplification (TS) approach is used to facilitate and improve a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. These tasks include Machine Translation, Information Extraction (IE), Text Summarization, and Open Information Extraction (Open IE). The semantic hierarchy helps in enriching the output of Open IE systems with contextual information, improving their accuracy and interpretability.
: The document does not provide specific information on how the author's work ranked among other submissions on the BioASQ challenge. It discusses the methodology, experiments, and results of the author's participation but does not mention the ranking or comparison with other submissions.
: The German-English dataset used in the study consisted of 159,000 parallel sentences for training and 7,584 for development. For testing, there were 2,000 sentences. Additionally, a Korean-English dataset with around 90,000 parallel sentences for training, 1,000 for development, and 2,000 for testing was also evaluated.
: The previous work's model mentioned in the document is a Ternary Trans-CNN model proposed by Mathur et al. This model architecture comprises of 3 layers of Convolution 1D with filter sizes of 15, 12, and 10 and kernel size of 3, followed by 2 dense fully connected layers of size 64 and 3. The first dense fully connected layer has ReLU activation, while the last Dense layer has Softmax activation. This model was trained on a parallel English dataset provided by Davidson et al. and achieved an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 80.2%, and recall of 69.8%.
: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool, even when provided with a large parallel corpus. This suggests that word-level semantics are well captured by mBERT contextual embeddings.

2. Learning an explicit projection of the representations had a negligible effect on the performance of the word-alignment task. This indicates that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings already contains sufficient semantic information for accurate word-level alignment.

3. The adversarial fine-tuning experiment, which aimed to remove language identity information from the representations, did not affect the performance of the word-alignment task. This further supports the idea that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings is capable of capturing semantic information necessary for accurate word-level alignment.

In summary, the document shows that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is capable of capturing semantic information at the word level, allowing for high-accuracy word-alignment tasks. This demonstrates the generality of the language-neutral component in modeling semantics.
: The document does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics for their system, CAiRE. However, it mentions that CAiRE was able to support more than 50 concurrent requests during a stress test using 8 GPUs, with each GTX 1080Ti running two independent processes achieving around 90% GPU utilization. Additionally, the system was able to receive traffic from more than 500 users in one week. The system's performance in terms of empathy and ethical responses was improved through active learning and negative training based on user feedback. However, specific performance measures such as accuracy, response time, or user satisfaction scores are not provided in the document.
err
: Yes, the document discusses the use of the state-of-the-art model, specifically the ESIM (Enhanced Sequential Inference Model), to analyze the attention mechanism in the context of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. The ESIM model is chosen for its complex neural architectures involving key mechanisms such as attention and repeated reading, which are seen in successful models for other NLP tasks. The authors provide an extensive analysis of the ESIM model's behavior, particularly focusing on the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals to understand the model's decision-making process.
: The correlation results for Sum-QE with human judgments are high or very high for all linguistic qualities (denoted as $\mathcal {Q}$s) in all datasets, except for $\mathcal {Q}2$ in DUC-05, where it is only moderate. The specific correlation values are not provided in the text. However, it is mentioned that Sum-QE achieves high correlations with human scores for most linguistic qualities rated on three different datasets (DUC-05, DUC-06, and DUC-07).

For a more detailed understanding of the correlation results, Table TABREF23 in the document would need to be referred to, as it presumably contains the specific correlation values (Spearman's $\rho$, Kendall's $\tau$, and Pearson's $r$) for all datasets and models.
: The paper discusses incorporating phrase-based word embedding for improved vocabulary mapping and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for generating more accurate target code for each line. These techniques aim to enhance the machine learning model's ability to translate human expressions into coding expressions more effectively.
: The deep learning model that performed better in this study was the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental results showed that CNNs outperformed both the deep autoencoders and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, achieving the highest accuracy of 82.6%.
: No, the document does not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. However, it does mention that the Quora duplicate question dataset, which was used to study the embeddings, is in English. The document also discusses the use of Google's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) Large, which is trained on a large corpus of English text. While the focus is primarily on English data, the methodologies and findings could potentially be applied to other languages with appropriate datasets and embeddings.
: No, the document does not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. However, it does mention that the tweets are downloaded using Twitter API, and it discusses features such as POS ratios and sentiment ratios, which are typically used in English language processing. To confirm whether the results are solely based on English data, additional information from the document would be required. If such information is not provided, it cannot be conclusively stated that the results are only on English data.
: The source of the OpenIE extractions was a corpus consisting of domain-targeted 80K sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages, used by BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining.
: Yes, the authors hypothesize that the dense approach substantially boosts the performance of the sparse approach due to its implicit handling of similar words. This is achieved through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. The smoothing capabilities of the dense approach, which reduce sparseness, are suggested as a reason for its superior performance. The authors recommend using the dense approach in further studies because of these advantages.
: The word embeddings used were created by Kyubyong Park and Edouard Grave. Park used fastText and word2vec methods to generate embeddings from the Wikipedia database backup dumps, resulting in a 100-dimensional vector with about 10k words. Grave and his team used the fastText tool to generate embeddings, which resulted in a 300-dimensional vector with approximately 200k words.
: The supplemental tasks used for multitask learning in the document are predicting the relationships of the three pairs: (oriQ/relQ), (oriQ/relC), and (relQ/relC). These tasks involve classifying whether the relationship between the original question (oriQ) and the related question (relQ), the original question (oriQ) and the external comment (relC), and the related question (relQ) and the external comment (relC) is relevant or irrelevant.
: Yes, they use multi-head attention (MHA) in their model. Specifically, they employ Intra-MHA for introspective context words modeling and Inter-MHA for context-perceptive target words modeling, which allows the model to perform multiple attention functions in parallel. This multi-head attention mechanism is a powerful tool for alignments and is more lightweight compared to traditional RNNs.
: The document does not specify the names of the datasets used for training and evaluating the JESSI model. It only mentions that JESSI was trained using only the datasets given on the SemEval 2019 Task 9: Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and Forums, without using any additional external data.
: The worst performer among the tested techniques was the Classification with Depeche++ Emotion lexicons BIBREF12 + Linear SVM (Depeche + SVM) benchmark. It achieved a lower performance compared to the other methods mentioned.
: Yes, the document suggests that CTC can be used to pretrain the RNN encoder to speed up the training of the joint CTC and SCRF model. This approach is analogous to sequence training of HMM acoustic models, where the network is usually pretrained by the frame-level cross-entropy (CE) criterion. The experiments showed that pretraining indeed improves the convergence speed of the joint model.
: The syntactic analysis demonstrates that the proposed method effectively controls the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as verbs and adjectives related to them, in the target language translations. Here are the key conclusions from the analysis:

1. Speaker's Gender Effects: The analysis shows that the injected prefixes ("He said", "I said", "She said") significantly influence the gender of the verbs associated with the first-person singular pronouns. The baseline system under-predicts the feminine form of verbs, while the "She said" prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion closer to the reference translation.

2. Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: The analysis reveals that the injected prefixes ("to them", "to him/her", "to her/them") affect the gender and number of second-person pronouns in the target language translations. The baseline system severely under-predicts the plural forms, while adding the "to them" prefix brings the proportion much closer to the reference translation.

In summary, the syntactic analysis confirms that the proposed black-box method successfully influences the morphological decisions made by the NMT system, resulting in translations that accurately reflect the desired gender and number properties of the speaker and audience. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in addressing the challenges posed by translating between languages with different morphological systems.

: The evaluation metrics used in the study include:

1. AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): This metric is used to evaluate the performance of the ranking models. It measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative instances.

2. Overall Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances (both positive and negative) among all instances.

3. Top-1 Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of instances where the model correctly ranks the most relevant joke at the top of the ranked list.

4. User Interruption Rate: This metric measures the rate at which users interrupt the VVA's joke experience. A lower interruption rate indicates higher user satisfaction.

5. Reuse of VVA Skills: This metric measures the frequency with which users reuse the VVA's joke skill. A higher reuse rate indicates higher user satisfaction.

6. Number of Active Dialogs: This metric measures the number of ongoing conversations between users and the VVA. A higher number of active dialogs indicates higher user engagement and satisfaction.

These metrics were used to compare the performance of different models and labeling strategies, and to assess their impact on user satisfaction.
: The representations for textual documents used in this research are vector space models (VSMs) with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights. In a VSM, each document is represented as a vector of TF-IDF values, where each term in the document corresponds to a dimension in the vector space. The TF-IDF weight measures the importance or uniqueness of a term within a set of documents, taking into account both the frequency of the term in a single document and its rarity across all documents. This representation allows for the computation of similarity between documents using various similarity measures.
: On average, there are 15 sentence transformations available per unique sentence in the COSTRA 1.0 dataset.
: On the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus (STS Corpus), the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.63%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model reported by BIBREF5.

For the Sanders dataset, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14) that used an ensemble of multiple base classifiers.

In the Health Care Reform (HCR) dataset, the proposed model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14), achieving better results in sentiment classification.

Overall, the proposed model demonstrated superior performance on all three datasets when compared to the state-of-the-art models and other approaches.
: The model described in the document, NetAb, differs from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in its approach and structure. NetAb uses two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle noisy labels during training for sentence-level sentiment classification (SSC). One CNN, called the A-network, predicts 'clean' sentiment labels, while the other, the Ab-network, estimates a noise transition matrix to manage input noisy labels. The networks are trained alternately using their respective loss functions.

On the other hand, GANs consist of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity, trying to distinguish between real and generated samples. The two networks compete against each other, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic samples and the discriminator improving its ability to detect them. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces samples indistinguishable from the real ones to the discriminator.

In summary, NetAb focuses on handling noisy labels in training data for SSC using two CNNs and an alternating training strategy, while GANs involve an adversarial process between a generator and a discriminator to create realistic synthetic data. The two models have different architectures, objectives, and applications.

: The seed lexicon is a collection consisting of 15 positive words and 15 negative words. These words are used to assign polarity scores to events, with positive events receiving a score of +1 and negative events receiving a score of -1. The seed lexicon is used to automatically extract and assign initial polarity scores to event pairs in the corpus, which the model then learns to refine through label propagation based on discourse relations.
: The aspects compared between various language models in the document include:

1. Perplexity: The document examines the decrease in perplexity on standard datasets for neural language models (AWD-LSTM and QRNN) compared to the traditional five-gram model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (KN-5).

2. Performance tradeoffs: The document explores the quality-performance tradeoff in the shift from non-neural (KN-5) to neural language models (AWD-LSTM and QRNN). This includes evaluating energy usage and inference latency on a Raspberry Pi, as well as under desktop environments.

3. Next-word prediction: The document compares the improvements in next-word prediction (measured by R@3 error) between the non-neural and neural language models.

4. Computational complexity: The document discusses the increased computational complexity of neural language models, which require large matrix multiplications and consume more floating point operations (FLOPs) compared to non-neural techniques.

5. Hardware cost: The document considers the cost of underlying hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi, CPU, and GPU, when deploying the language models.

6. Latency and energy usage: The document compares the latency and energy usage of the different language models, both on resource-constrained platforms like the Raspberry Pi and desktop environments.

7. Perplexity-recall relationship: The document investigates the relationship between log perplexity and recall-at-k metrics, showing that perplexity does not have a strictly monotonic relationship with recall-at-k.

8. Model architecture: The document compares the architecture of the neural language models (QRNN and AWD-LSTM) with the non-neural approach (KN-5), including the number of layers, hidden units, and window sizes.

9. Model training and optimization: The document discusses the training procedures, optimization techniques, and regularization methods used for the neural language models (AWD-LSTM and QRNN) and the non-neural model (KN-5).

The document concludes that while neural language models achieve significant reductions in perplexity, they come with substantial increases in computational requirements, latency, and energy usage, which may not always be justifiable depending on the application.
: The document does not explicitly mention which specific baselines were compared in the study. The authors mention using a baseline model from See et al. See2017 trained on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, but there is no further comparison with other models or baselines provided in the given text. To identify the baselines compared, one would need additional information or context from the document.
: This paper targets Brazilian Portuguese. It discusses the use of machine learning techniques in Brazil and specifically analyzes gender bias in Portuguese word embeddings.
: No, the document does not explicitly state that any experiments were conducted using the dataset. It describes the creation and features of the dataset, as well as its limitations and potential for future research, but it does not mention any specific experiments that were performed.
: The document does not provide specific information on whether experiments were conducted using the CORD-19-NER dataset. It mainly describes the creation, structure, and potential uses of the dataset for named entity recognition in COVID-19 studies. The authors mention their future plans to improve the dataset and build text mining systems based on it, but no details about experiments are given.
: The quality of UniSent is measured by comparing it with manually created sentiment lexicons in different languages and domains. The comparison is done using test sets, where UniSent's performance is evaluated against the Baseline-Lexicon (which uses words from the gold standard lexicon) and the gold standard lexicons themselves. The results are presented in tables (TABREF13 and TABREF14) that show UniSent's performance in terms of outperforming the baseline and being close to manually annotated data. The modest gains from domain adaptation are also noted. The specific metrics used for this comparison are not explicitly mentioned in the document.
: The sample size used to measure user satisfaction in the study was 34,432 user conversations.
: The document does not explicitly state that the authors only report on English. It mentions the use of Wikipedia revisions, which are primarily in English, but it does not specify that the entire study or corpus is limited to English. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be conclusively determined that the authors report only on English. If I don't know the answer, I would say "I don't know."
: The algorithm used for the classification tasks in the document is the Random Forest Ensemble classifier.
: Traditional methods for identifying important attributes in knowledge graphs typically involve post-processing steps after automated attribute-value extraction. Some of these methods include:

1. BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, and BIBREF4: These approaches extract potential class-attribute pairs using linguistically motivated patterns from unstructured text, such as query logs and query sessions, and then score the attributes using models like the Bayes model.

2. BIBREF3: This method proposes identifying product attributes from customer online reviews using part-of-speech (POS) tagging patterns, and evaluating their importance with frequency metrics.

3. BIBREF4: Lee et al. developed a system to extract concept-attribute pairs from multiple data sources, including Probase, general web documents, query logs, and external knowledge bases. It aggregates weights from different sources into a consistent typicality score using a Ranking SVM model.

These methods often rely on pattern rules and ranking processes to identify more precise attributes from candidates. However, they may suffer from poor quality of pattern rules and the challenge of determining the relative importance of attributes. Additionally, they usually do not consider semantic similarity or the context in which attributes are mentioned, which can lead to less accurate identification of significant attributes.
: The study found that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable development (Topic 7) in their annual UN General Debate statements varies according to several country-specific factors. These factors include wealth, measured by GDP per capita; population size; levels of official development assistance (ODA) received; democracy, measured by the Polity IV index; and conflict, as indicated by the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. The relationship between these factors and the discussion of sustainable development is not linear but shows significant fluctuations. For instance, poorer countries tend to discuss both economic development (Topic 2) and sustainable development more than wealthier countries, but the discussion of sustainable development increases at higher wealth levels until around $60,000 per capita, after which it declines. Additionally, highly autocratic states discuss sustainable development more than slightly less autocratic states, possibly to divert attention from democracy and human rights issues. There are also regional effects, with countries in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific discussing sustainable development the most, while countries in North America discuss it the least. The study suggests that these relationships warrant further analysis and exploration.
: The authors present several experiments to validate their system:

1. Performance evaluation across various domains: The authors measure the system's performance on datasets across different domains, using managed judges who understand the knowledge base to judge user queries' relevance to the QA pairs. They filter out data for which judges do not agree on the label, and they present results for both knowledge bases with and without chit-chat data, as well as performance on just chit-chat data.

2. Usage statistics: The authors provide statistics on the usage of their system, such as the percentage of knowledge bases created using pre-built persona-based chit-chat, the acceptance to reject ratio for active learning suggestions, and the sources used for creating knowledge bases.

3. Novel features demonstration: The authors demonstrate the novel features of their system, such as personality-grounded chit-chat, active learning based on user-interaction feedback, and hierarchical extraction for multi-turn conversations. They show how easy it is to create an intelligent bot using QnAMaker and provide a demo video.

4. Future improvements: The authors mention future experiments and improvements they plan to implement, such as highlighting answer spans, generating KB-grounded responses, user-defined personas for chit-chat, and enhancing extraction capabilities for unstructured documents and images. They also plan to improve their ranking system by using semantic vector-based search and transformer-based models for re-ranking.

These experiments and statistics help validate the effectiveness and usability of the QnAMaker system, as well as highlight areas for future improvement.
: The document does not explicitly mention the method used to measure robustness in the experiments. Robustness in machine learning typically refers to the ability of a model to maintain its performance when faced with variations or perturbations in the input data. Common approaches to measure robustness include testing the model on adversarial examples, evaluating performance across different datasets, or introducing noise or variations to the input data and observing the impact on the model's output.

To determine the specific method used in this context, one would need to refer to the section of the document where robustness is discussed. Since the provided text does not contain such details, it is not possible to state how robustness was measured in these experiments.

If you have access to the full document, you may need to look for a section that discusses experimental setup, evaluation metrics, or robustness testing to find the answer.
: The document does not specify the exact ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system(s) used in the work. It mentions the use of ASR hypotheses but does not provide details on the specific ASR technology or system employed.
: Yes, the semantic hierarchy representation generated by the discourse-aware syntactic text simplification approach is used to facilitate and improve various artificial intelligence tasks. It is particularly useful as a preprocessing step for tasks like Machine Translation, Information Extraction (IE), and Text Summarization. Additionally, it enhances the performance of Open IE systems by providing contextual information that improves the interpretability of complex assertions.
: The document does not provide specific information on how the author's work ranked among other submissions on the BioASQ challenge. It discusses the methodology, experiments, and results of the author's participation, but does not mention the ranking or position of their submission.
: The German-English dataset used in the study consisted of 159,000 parallel sentences for training and 7,584 for development. Additionally, there were 20,000 sentences for testing. The subword vocabulary size for BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) segmentation was set to 30,000 merge operations.
: The previous work's model mentioned in the document is a Ternary Trans-CNN model proposed by Mathur et al. This model architecture comprises of 3 layers of Convolution 1D with filter sizes of 15, 12, and 10, and a kernel size of 3. It is followed by 2 dense fully connected layers, with the first dense layer having ReLU activation and the last dense layer having Softmax activation. The model was trained on a parallel English dataset provided by Davidson et al. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 80.2%, and recall of 69.8%.
: The document demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment through the following points:

1. Word-alignment task: The authors use mBERT representations to perform word-alignment between English and other languages (Czech, Swedish, German, French, and Romanian). They compare the results of mBERT-based word-alignment with FastAlign, which was provided with a large parallel corpus. The mBERT-based word-alignment surpasses the performance of FastAlign, suggesting that mBERT contextual embeddings capture word-level semantics effectively.

2. Explicit projection: The authors also evaluate the impact of explicitly learning a projection of mBERT representations onto the English space. They find that this projection leads to a significant improvement in word-alignment performance, reaching close-to-perfect accuracy. This indicates that the language-neutral component of mBERT embeddings can be effectively utilized for cross-lingual tasks like word-alignment.

3. Hierarchical clustering: The document also shows that the similarity of language centroids in mBERT embeddings tends to correspond to the similarity of languages, as confirmed by hierarchical clustering of the language centroids. This further supports the idea that mBERT embeddings capture language-neutral semantic information.

In summary, the high-accuracy word-alignment performance achieved using mBERT embeddings, along with the positive results of explicitly learning a projection onto the English space, demonstrates that the language-neutral component of mBERT contextual embeddings is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics for cross-lingual tasks like word-alignment.
: The document does not provide specific quantitative performance metrics for their system. However, it mentions that the system, CAiRE, has been able to handle traffic from more than 500 users within a week of its release. It also highlights that the system has received feedback, including reports of unethical dialogues, which the developers are actively working to improve through active learning and negative training. The system's performance seems to be improving over time as it learns from user interactions and feedback.
: The authors propose a more nuanced and practical approach to defining and evaluating the faithfulness of interpretations provided by machine learning models. Here are the key approaches they suggest:

1. Distinguish between Faithfulness and Plausibility:
   - Clearly separate the evaluation of faithfulness (how accurately an interpretation reflects the model's reasoning process) from plausibility (how convincing the interpretation is to humans).
   - Avoid conflating the two, as conflation can lead to dangerous scenarios, especially in sensitive fields.

2. Develop a Graded Criteria for Faithfulness:
   - Instead of evaluating interpretations in a binary manner (faithful or not faithful), introduce a graded scale that measures the extent and likelihood of an interpretation being faithful.
   - This allows for interpretations to be considered useful even if they are not perfectly faithful, acknowledging the inherent limitations of model approximations.

3. Formalize and Evaluate Faithfulness:
   - Establish formal definitions and evaluation methods for faithfulness.
   - Encourage the community to develop concrete evaluations methods for these criteria.

4. Address Common Pitfalls in Literature:
   - Identify and address common issues in the literature, such as the use of human judgment for evaluating faithfulness, which is not feasible due to the complexity of model reasoning.
   - Recognize the limitations of current evaluation methods, which often focus on proving a method is not faithful through counter-examples.

5. Organize Literature Around Assumptions:
   - Expose the underlying assumptions that underlie various evaluation methods, enabling a more structured discussion on their validity and merit.

6. Consider Faithfulness Across Models, Tasks, and Input Spaces:
   - Evaluate faithfulness on a case-by-case basis, considering specific models, tasks, or subspaces of the input space.
   - Some models or tasks may allow sufficiently faithful interpretations, while others may not.

The authors emphasize the need for a more practical and nuanced methodology for defining and evaluating faithfulness, which can lead to more useful and trustworthy interpretations in practice. They also call for the community to take up the challenge of developing formal definitions and evaluation methods for faithfulness.
: Yes, the document mentions that they use the state-of-the-art model for the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task, specifically referring to the ESIM model variants (ESIM-50 and ESIM-300) for their analysis. The ESIM model is highlighted as a key component in their study to interpret the behavior of deep learning-based models in the challenging task of Natural Language Inference.
: The correlation results for the Sum-QE model with human judgments across different datasets and linguistic quality criteria are as follows:

1. Spearman's ρ: High or very high correlation for all datasets and quality criteria, except for $\mathcal{Q}2$ in DUC-05, where it is moderate.
2. Kendall's τ: High or very high correlation for all datasets and quality criteria, except for $\mathcal{Q}2$ in DUC-05, where it is moderate.
3. Pearson's r: High or very high correlation for all datasets and quality criteria, except for $\mathcal{Q}2$ in DUC-05, where it is moderate.

The Sum-QE model performs well in predicting human scores for most linguistic qualities rated, on three different datasets (DUC-05, DUC-06, and DUC-07). However, it struggles to rank the summaries correctly for $\mathcal{Q}2$ in DUC-05, where the manual scores are the highest among all quality criteria and years, and the standard deviation is the smallest.

The BERT multi-task versions perform better with highly correlated qualities like $\mathcal{Q}4$ and $\mathcal{Q}5$, but there is not a clear winner among them due to mathematical equivalence and stochastic learning algorithms.

Overall, the Sum-QE model achieves high correlations with human scores for most linguistic qualities, demonstrating its potential for estimating summary quality without human references. Future work will involve extending the model to capture content-related aspects and applying it to other domains and types of texts.
: The paper discusses the incorporation of several techniques to improve the translation of natural language to programming code. These include:

1. Neural approach: The paper proposes a neural approach to translate pseudo-code or algorithm-like human language expressions into programming language code.

2. Vocabulary generation: Two separate vocabulary files are created for the source texts and code, using tokenization and word2vec to convert words into their contextual vector space.

3. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model: The paper utilizes an open-source NMT implementation, OpenNMT, with PyTorch as the neural network coding framework. The model uses three types of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers - an encoder layer, a decoder layer, and an output layer, forming a LSTM model.

4. Attention mechanism: The attention mechanism is used to overcome the fixed-length restriction of encoder-decoder sequence and allows processing variable-length input and output sequences.

5. Sigmoidal optimization: This optimization technique is used to optimize the prediction during training.

6. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): The paper suggests that incorporating an AST model could improve the accuracy of the generated code by providing a more structured representation of the code.

7. Phrase-based word embedding: The paper mentions that incorporating phrase-based word embedding could improve vocabulary mapping and generate more accurate target code for each line.

These techniques aim to improve the accuracy and coherence of the generated code, and to explore the possibility of a unified programming interface in the future.
: The deep learning model that performed better in this study was the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental results showed that CNNs outperformed both the deep autoencoders and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, achieving the highest accuracy of 82.6%.
: No, the authors do not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. The document discusses the use of various embeddings and datasets, including the Quora duplicate question dataset, which is not limited to English. However, the document does not provide specific details on the languages of the data used beyond the mention of English. Therefore, it is not clear whether the results are solely based on English data or if they also include other languages.
: No, the document does not explicitly state that the results are only on English data. However, it mentions that the tweets are downloaded using Twitter API, which is primarily for English-language tweets. The document focuses on English-language social media content, but it does not explicitly state that the results are exclusive to English data.
: The source of the OpenIE extractions was a text corpus (S) consisting of 80K domain-targeted sentences and 280 GB of plain text extracted from web pages, used by BIBREF6 aristo2016:combining.
: Yes, the authors hypothesize that the dense mode outperformed the sparse one primarily due to its implicit handling of similar words through the averaging of dense word vectors for semantically related words. This averaging process helps to reduce sparseness and improve the representation of word senses, leading to better performance in word sense disambiguation tasks. The dense approach's ability to capture semantic similarities between words provides a more robust and nuanced understanding of word meanings in context, which is crucial for accurate disambiguation.
: The word embeddings used were created by Kyubyong Park and Edouard Grave. Park used fastText and word2vec methods to generate embeddings from the Wikipedia database backup dumps, resulting in a 100-dimensional vector with about 10k words. Grave and his team used the fastText tool to generate embeddings, which resulted in a 300-dimensional vector with approximately 200k words.
: The supplemental tasks used for multitask learning in the document are predicting the relationships of the three pairs: (oriQ/relQ), (oriQ/relC), and (relQ/relC). These tasks involve classifying the relevance of original questions to related comments, original questions to external comments, and related questions to external comments, respectively. The multitask learning framework aims to improve the main task by leveraging commonalities among all tasks.
: Yes, they use multi-head attention (MHA) in their model. MHA is utilized to learn different scores in parallel child spaces, which is powerful for alignments. The model uses both Intra-MHA for introspective context words modeling and Inter-MHA for context-perceptive target words modeling, with each serving a specific purpose.
: The document does not specify the names of the datasets used for training and evaluating the JESSI model. It only mentions that JESSI was trained using only the datasets provided on the SemEval 2019 Task 9: Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and Forums shared task.
: The worst performer among the tested techniques was the Classification with Depeche++ Emotion lexicons BIBREF12 + Linear SVM (Depeche + SVM). It achieved a lower performance compared to the other methods, particularly BERT, which achieved the best result with a 0.604 micro-F1 score.
: Yes, the document suggests that CTC can be used to pretrain the RNN encoder to speed up the training of the joint model, which implies that SCRF can be used in a pretraining capacity to improve the performance of the model.
: The syntactic analysis conducted in the document demonstrates that the proposed method effectively controls the morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as the verbs and adjectives related to them, in the target language translations. Here are the key conclusions from the analysis:

1. Speaker's Gender Effects: The analysis showed that the injected speaker information (e.g., "He said," "She said") significantly influenced the morphological properties of the verbs in the translated sentences. The method improved the accuracy of gender-inflected verbs, bringing the proportion closer to the reference translation. This indicates that the method successfully controlled the gender of the speaker in the target language translations.

2. Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: The analysis revealed that the injected audience information (e.g., "to them") had a significant impact on the morphological properties of second-person pronouns and their governing verbs in the translated sentences. The method improved the accuracy of singular and plural second-person pronouns, bringing the proportion closer to the reference translation. This demonstrates that the method effectively controlled the gender and number of the audience in the target language translations.

In summary, the syntactic analysis confirms that the proposed method successfully influences the morphological decisions of a pre-trained NMT system, even when the source language does not provide explicit gender and number information. The method enables the generation of target language translations with accurate morphological realization of first and second-person pronouns, as well as their related verbs and adjectives, based on the injected speaker and audience information.
: The normalization techniques mentioned in the document are cepstral mean normalization (CMN) and using deltas and delta-deltas. CMN is found to perform better than raw FBanks, while using deltas and delta-deltas also improves the model, although the difference when using CMN is not very significant compared to FBanks. The document also mentions that using variance with mean normalization (CMVN) was found unnecessary for the task.
: The evaluation metrics used in the study were AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) and overall accuracy. Additionally, top-1 accuracy was used to evaluate the ranking capabilities of the proposed methods. These metrics helped to assess the performance of the models in terms of their ability to correctly rank jokes for the users.
: The research uses vector space representations for textual documents, specifically employing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weights. In this representation, each document is depicted as a vector within a vector space model (VSM), where each term in the document is associated with a weight based on its TF-IDF value. This approach allows for the comparison and analysis of documents based on the frequency and importance of terms within them.
: On average, there are 15 sentence transformations available per unique sentence in the COSTRA 1.0 dataset.
: On the Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus (STS Corpus), the proposed model achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.63%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model reported by BIBREF5.

For the Sanders dataset, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14) that used an ensemble of multiple base classifiers.

In the Health Care Reform (HCR) dataset, the proposed model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model (BIBREF14) that used an ensemble of multiple base classifiers.

Overall, the proposed model showed improved performance on all three datasets compared to the state-of-the-art models and the models that did not use semantic rules (SR). The use of semantic rules and character-level information significantly contributed to the increased classification accuracy.
: The model described in the document, NetAb, differs from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in its approach and structure. NetAb uses two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle noisy labels during training for sentence-level sentiment classification. One CNN, called the A-network, predicts 'clean' sentiment labels, while the other, the Ab-network, estimates a noise transition matrix to manage noisy labels. The networks are trained alternately using their respective loss functions.

On the other hand, GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator creates data that is as realistic as possible, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of both real and generated data. The goal of the generator is to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator aims to correctly distinguish between real and fake data. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that is indistinguishable from the real data.

In summary, NetAb focuses on handling noisy labels in sentiment classification by estimating and using a noise transition matrix, while GANs are based on an adversarial process to generate realistic data. The two models have different architectures and objectives, with NetAb specifically addressing the challenge of noisy data in sentiment analysis, and GANs being used for generating new data samples.
: The performance of both the i-vector system and the x-vector system on their respective datasets was not explicitly mentioned in terms of specific error rates or percentages in the provided text. However, it was indicated that the system trained purely on VoxCeleb performed well on SITW(S), which is a dataset similar to CN-Celeb(E).

For the pure CN-Celeb system, the performance on CN-Celeb(E) was poor, with an EER of 14.24%. When the back-end model was retrained with VoxCeleb(L), the performance on SITW improved to 11.34%, which was better than the performance on CN-Celeb(E). This suggests that CN-Celeb is more challenging than VoxCeleb for speaker recognition research.

To get specific performance metrics, such as EER, one would need to refer to Table TABREF24 and Table TABREF26 in the original document, which are not provided in your text. Therefore, I cannot give a precise numerical answer based on the given information. If you need exact performance figures, I would need access to the tables or the full text of the document.
