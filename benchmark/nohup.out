The networks, which transmit from Dubai, had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. The ban prevents the networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. The Pakistani government has made several demands of the networks, including censoring content and removing certain anchors and hosts. Musharraf's emergency order restricts journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to Pakistan's ideology or integrity, covering militant activity, and ridiculing government or armed forces members. The order aims to improve stability and foster peaceful parliamentary elections. Opposition leaders accuse Musharraf of using the emergency rule to maintain power.

: Eduardo Gonzalez, a U.S. Navy petty officer second class, faces deployment overseas for the third time. His wife, Mildred, is at risk of deportation to Guatemala, their home country since 1989. Gonzalez worries about the impact on his young son if his wife is deported while he defends the U.S. Gonzalez testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel, urging officials to consider a policy for military members' families facing deportation. The U.S. military currently handles such cases on an individual basis, with no overall policy in place. Immigration officials clarify that marrying a U.S. citizen does not guarantee legal status or permanent residency. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, an immigration law expert, believes there should be an overall policy addressing the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. The government's dilemma stems from providing assistance to military families while simultaneously trying to deport the same individuals. In Gonzalez's case, his wife's legal status remains uncertain due to their marriage, which canceled her mother's legalization application. If her status does not change by June 8, 2008, she risks deportation. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, criticizes the situation as "amnesty for illegal immigrants with a relative in the armed forces."

: Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter star, turns 18 and gains access to a £20 million fortune. However, he plans not to be extravagant, preferring to spend on books, CDs, and DVDs. Despite his fame and wealth, Radcliffe aims to stay grounded, avoiding the "kid star goes off the rails" stereotype. He will continue his Harry Potter role in the final two films, while also working on other projects like "My Boy Jack," "December Boys," and a stage debut in "Equus." As an adult, he anticipates increased media scrutiny.

: CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien explores the "forgotten floor" of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, where mentally ill inmates await trial. Judge Steven Leifman, an advocate for justice and the mentally ill, explains that these individuals often face avoidable felonies due to confrontations with police, exacerbating their mental illness. The conditions on the ninth floor are harsh, with prisoners in sleeveless robes, no shoes, laces, or mattresses, designed to prevent self-harm. Approximately one-third of Miami-Dade county jail inmates are mentally ill, overwhelming the system. Leifman is working to change this by redirecting inmates to a new mental health facility starting in 2008, aiming for long-term treatment rather than punishment. This initiative is seen as a win-win solution, benefiting patients, families, and the state.

: In Amman, Jordan, the Shmisani Institute for Girls has seen a significant increase in Iraqi students due to a new government policy allowing all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status, to enroll in state-funded schools. Principal Sanaa Abu Harb reports that 145 Iraqi students, roughly 20% of the school's population, are currently enrolled, with another 40 on a waiting list.

: Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter star, turns 18 and gains access to a reported £20 million fortune. However, he plans not to be extravagant, preferring to spend on books, CDs, and DVDs. Despite his fame and wealth, Radcliffe aims to stay grounded, avoiding the "kid star goes off the rails" stereotype. He will continue his Harry Potter role in the last two films, while also working on other projects like "My Boy Jack," "December Boys," and a stage debut in "Equus." He anticipates increased media scrutiny as an adult.

: CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien explores the "forgotten floor" of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, where mentally ill inmates await trial. Judge Steven Leifman, an advocate for justice and the mentally ill, explains that these individuals often face avoidable felonies due to confrontations with police, exacerbating their mental health issues. The conditions on the ninth floor are harsh, with no shoes, laces, or mattresses to prevent self-harm. Approximately one-third of Miami-Dade county jail inmates are mentally ill, overwhelming the system. Leifman aims to change this by redirecting inmates to a new mental health facility starting in 2008, offering long-term treatment instead of repeated incarceration. This initiative is seen as a win-win solution, benefiting patients, families, and the state.

: Five small polyps were removed from President Bush's colon during a procedure at Camp David. The polyps, less than half an inch in diameter, were sent for microscopic examination at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Results are expected in two to three days. The president, under monitored anesthesia care, was asleep but not deeply unconscious. Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power during the procedure, which was supervised by Bush's physician, Dr. Richard Tubb, and conducted by a team from the National Naval Medical Center. No abnormalities were found during Bush's last colonoscopy in June 2002. The American Cancer Society recommends screening for colorectal cancer at age 50 for those without high risk factors or symptoms.

: Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick has been indefinitely suspended by the NFL without pay due to his involvement in a dogfighting ring. Vick admitted to federal prosecutors in Virginia that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not perform well in fighting sessions. The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, stated that Vick's actions were illegal, cruel, and tarnished the NFL's reputation. The Falcons could seek to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from his 2004 contract. Vick is expected to plead guilty to conspiracy charges related to the dogfighting ring and may face up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement, and Vick has agreed to cooperate with investigators and make restitution for the costs associated with the seized dogs.

: A study suggests that the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) found in healthy Australian honey bees may contribute to colony collapse disorder (CCD) in U.S. bee colonies.

However, researchers caution that CCD is likely caused by multiple factors, including genetic weaknesses, pathogens, pesticides, pollutants, and varroa mites, which are not found in Australia. The study offers hope for breeding disease- and pest-resistant bees, as some bees show genetic resistance to IAPV. Further research is needed to determine if IAPV alone or in combination with other factors can induce CCD in healthy bees.

In Egypt, Karam paid $5,300 to buy a kidney for his sister. Hakan, a security guard in Istanbul, is seeking $30,700 for one of his kidneys. The dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries has led to organ trafficking and a black market, with foreigners traveling to poorer countries like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia, and the Philippines to buy body parts. The World Health Organization estimates a global demand of at least 90,000 liver transplants annually, far exceeding the 20,000 carried out in China, which recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners. In Pakistan, a "kidney bazaar" has emerged, with patients from Europe, Saudi Arabia, and India paying around $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors receive $300 to $1,000 with no medical care post-surgery.

: Eduardo Gonzalez, a U.S. Navy petty officer second class, is about to be deployed overseas for the third time. His wife, Mildred, faces potential deportation to Guatemala, their home country they haven't seen since 1989. Gonzalez worries about his young son, Eduardo Jr., if his wife is deported. Gonzalez testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel, urging officials to consider a policy for military members' families facing deportation while defending their country. The U.S. military does not have a specific policy for such cases, which are handled on a case-by-case basis by immigration authorities. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves, believes there should be an overall policy addressing the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, opposes such a policy, viewing it as amnesty for illegal immigrants with a relative in the military.

: In Miami, the "forgotten floor" of the pretrial detention facility houses mentally ill inmates awaiting trial. Judge Steven Leifman, an advocate for justice and the mentally ill, explains that these individuals often face avoidable felonies due to confrontations with police, exacerbating their mental health issues. The conditions on the ninth floor are harsh, with prisoners in sleeveless robes, no shoes, laces, or mattresses, designed to prevent self-harm. Approximately one-third of Miami-Dade county jail inmates are mentally ill, overwhelming the system. Leifman has become a strong advocate for change, citing historical mistreatment of the mentally ill and the current cycle of incarceration without proper treatment. Starting in 2008, a new mental health facility will divert some inmates from the "forgotten floor," marking a step towards long-term treatment and a win-win solution for patients, families, and the state.

: Tony Snow, White House press secretary undergoing cancer treatment, steps down on September 14. He will be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino. Snow's cancer diagnosis in February 2005 led to a colon removal and six months of treatment, followed by remission. However, his cancer recurred, leading to a recent decision to leave his job. Despite his health challenges, Snow's condition is stable with no new growths, and he plans to continue speaking out on issues.

: President Bush, in anticipation of a crucial progress report on Iraq, seeks to reframe the war's comparison to Vietnam by drawing on historical lessons. He argues that withdrawal from Vietnam led to suffering for innocent citizens and emboldened terrorists, citing Osama bin Laden's quote. Bush also references the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan post-WWII and the Korean War, emphasizing the importance of America's commitment to democracy and its word. His speeches aim to provide context for the Iraq progress report amidst declining public support for the war.

: Paul Lee, a chief subway technician in Hong Kong, received a liver transplant from an executed Chinese prisoner due to a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries. The procedure cost him 260,000 yuan ($34,380) and was facilitated by connections with a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city. Similarly, Karam in Egypt paid $5,300 for a kidney for his sister, while Hakan in Istanbul is seeking $30,700 for one of his kidneys. The demand for organs far exceeds supply, leading to organ trafficking and a black market for transplants. Despite calls for regulation, the trade persists due to loopholes in laws and a lack of transparency. In Pakistan, the trade is not illegal, and the country is turning into a "kidney bazaar," with foreigners paying up to $8,500 for a new kidney. The World Health Organization and other bodies are advocating for stricter regulations and transparency in the transplant trade.
: Hollywood filmmakers are debating whether to insure Lindsay Lohan's future movies following her recent legal troubles. The cost of insuring her could be high, potentially affecting her career.

Producers may face higher deductibles or require actors to put their salaries into escrow to cover potential losses. The decision on whether to proceed with Lohan's involvement in "Poor Things" is pending.

Kouchner's visit to Iraq and his support for human rights-based intervention in Darfur reflect France's assertive diplomatic style under President Nicolas Sarkozy. While neither Kouchner nor Sarkozy advocate immediate military action against Iran, they emphasize the escalating risks due to Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Kouchner's intervention signals France's intent to reclaim a prominent role in global diplomacy.
: 1. "Für Elise" was originally titled "Bagatelle in A minor" and possibly written for Therese Malfatti, not Elise.
2. "Philadelphia Freedom" was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin as a thank-you to Billie Jean King for a tracksuit, referencing her tennis team.
3. "Lola" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, but Ray Davies also claims it was inspired by a drunken encounter with a woman.
4. "867-5309/Jenny" was written by Jim Keller and Alex Call, with no specific inspiration, but the phone number has since become notorious for crank calls.
5. "Oh, Carol" was written by Neil Sedaka for Carole King, which inspired King to write "Oh, Neil," leading to her and Gerry Goffin's successful songwriting careers.

: In the 2008 election cycle, historic spending on political and issue-advocacy advertising is expected, with costs potentially exceeding $3 billion. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV ads among presidential contenders, airing his commercials over 11,000 times at nearly $8.6 million. The political ads have been largely focused on early states, but expectations are for all frontrunner candidates to start airing commercials before the end of October. The sheer volume of ads may dilute their impact, requiring commercials to be particularly effective to stand out. Unforeseen events could also influence spending.

: Michael Moore criticizes CNN's Sanjay Gupta for reporting on his film "Sicko," claiming Gupta fudged facts. Moore argues his film's facts were backed by his staff and that Gupta aired the report knowing the facts were incorrect. Gupta defends his report, praising Moore's film for raising awareness but expressing concern that it implies healthcare in other countries is free, despite high taxes. Moore counters that Americans pay more in copays, deductibles, and insurance premiums. Gupta questions Moore's proposed solution of government control, while Moore accuses the current system of being profit-driven and cumbersome for doctors. Both agree on the need to fix America's healthcare system.

: Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter star, turns 18 and gains access to a reported £20 million fortune. However, he plans not to be extravagant, preferring to spend on books, CDs, and DVDs. Despite his fame and wealth, Radcliffe aims to stay grounded, avoiding the pitfalls of a "kid star." He will continue his Harry Potter role in the last two films, while also working on other projects like "My Boy Jack," "December Boys," and a stage debut in "Equus." He anticipates increased media scrutiny as an adult.
: CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien explores the "forgotten floor" of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, where mentally ill inmates await trial. Judge Steven Leifman discusses the overwhelming number of mentally ill individuals in the jail system, often due to confrontations with police that exacerbate their conditions. The environment is described as harsh, with inmates wearing restrictive robes and lacking basic comforts like shoes and mattresses. Leifman advocates for change, highlighting a new mental health facility initiative starting in 2008 to provide long-term treatment instead of repeated incarceration. This approach is seen as beneficial for patients, their families, and cost-effective for the state.
: Survivors of the Minneapolis bridge collapse recounted harrowing tales of survival, including a 35-foot free fall and rescuing children from the wreckage. Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, rushed to the scene and coordinated a rescue effort that managed to get 55 people into ambulances in under two hours. Survivors like Gary Babineau, who had no rescue training, acted instinctively to save lives amidst the chaos. Bernie Toivonen's vehicle ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle but remained upright after the collapse.
: President Bush had five small polyps removed from his colon during a procedure at Camp David. The polyps, less than half an inch in diameter, were sent for microscopic examination at the National Naval Medical Center. Results are expected in two to three days. The procedure was performed under monitored anesthesia care, and Bush resumed his activities shortly after. Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power during the procedure, which was supervised by Bush's physician, Dr. Richard Tubb. The president's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, with no abnormalities found. The American Cancer Society recommends screening for colorectal cancer at age 50 for those without high risk factors.
: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay due to his involvement in a dogfighting ring. Vick admitted to federal prosecutors in Virginia that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not perform well in fighting sessions. The suspension is seen as a strong statement against conduct that tarnishes the NFL's reputation. The Falcons could seek to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from his 2004 contract. Vick is expected to plead guilty to a federal charge related to the dogfighting ring and may face additional local charges. The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement.
: Youssif, a 5-year-old boy from Baghdad, Iraq, suffered severe burns when he was set on fire by masked men on January 15. His parents, Zainab and her husband, struggled to find help in their war-torn country, even appealing to Iraq's parliament. After sharing their story with CNN, they received an outpouring of global support. The Children's Burn Foundation, based in California, agreed to cover all medical costs for Youssif's treatment in the United States, including surgeries performed by Dr. Peter Grossman. The foundation also set up a fund for donations. Despite the challenges of obtaining visas and the security risks they face in Iraq, Youssif's family now has new hope thanks to the generosity of people worldwide.
: In Baghdad, Iraq, women like Suha and Karima are forced into prostitution due to extreme poverty, violence, and lack of government aid. Suha, a 37-year-old mother of three, and Karima, a widow with five children, sell their bodies for as little as $8 a day to provide for their families. Despite the societal stigma and personal shame, these women prioritize their children's survival over their own dignity. Humanitarian workers and activists are working to bring attention to their plight and advocate for government intervention.

The army's Rapid Response Force, supported by the Colombian Air Force, found 14 dead rebels, weapons, communications equipment, and four GPS systems at the FARC camp.
: Tony Snow, White House press secretary undergoing cancer treatment, will resign on September 14. He will be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino. Snow's cancer diagnosis in February 2005 led to a colon removal and six months of treatment, followed by remission. However, his cancer recurred, leading to further treatment. Despite his health challenges, Snow's recent medical tests show stable tumors and no new growths. He plans to continue speaking out on issues and may do some radio and TV work, but not full-time anchor duties. President Bush expressed his love and wishes for Snow's well-being.
: An empty 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube was found on the front lawn of a Jersey City home, leading to an investigation by the FBI and Jersey City police. The launcher, which is no longer operable and not considered a public safety hazard, has been turned over to the 754th Ordnance Company at Fort Monmouth. The origin and circumstances of the rocket launcher's appearance on residential property are being investigated, with no indication that it had been recently fired. The device, described as a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against ground targets, has a picture of a soldier on it and measures 3 to 4 feet long.
: President Bush compares the Iraq war to Vietnam, citing historical lessons to argue against withdrawal. He highlights the consequences of America's withdrawal from Vietnam, including the suffering of innocent citizens and the emboldening of today's terrorists. Bush also draws parallels to the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after WWII and the Korean War, emphasizing America's commitment to democracy and freedom. The speech aims to provide context for the upcoming Iraq progress report amid declining public support for the war.

: Attacks in northeastern Baghdad have decreased by 75% recently, leading a U.S. military officer to report significant security improvements. The return of civilians, city workers, and markets, along with the crushing of Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence since May, have contributed to this positive trend.

The detention system is described as "open and transparent," providing detainees with medical care, food, water, educational opportunities, job skills, and family contact.

: Eduardo Gonzalez, a U.S. Navy petty officer second class, faces deployment overseas for the third time. His wife, Mildred, is at risk of deportation to Guatemala, their home country since 1989. Gonzalez worries about the impact on his young son if his wife is deported while he defends the U.S. Gonzalez testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel, urging officials to consider a policy for military members' families facing deportation. The U.S. military currently handles such cases on an individual basis, with no overall policy in place. Immigration officials clarify that marrying a U.S. citizen does not guarantee legal status or permanent residency. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, an immigration law expert, believes there should be an overall policy addressing the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. The government's dilemma stems from providing assistance to military families while simultaneously trying to deport the same individuals. In Gonzalez's case, his wife's legal status remains uncertain due to their marriage, which canceled her mother's legalization application. If her status does not change by June 8, 2008, she risks deportation. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, criticizes the situation as "amnesty for illegal immigrants with a relative in the armed forces."

However, opponents like Cortez, the mayor of McAllen, Texas, believe that alternative measures such as hiring more agents and improving the Rio Grande would be more effective. The Texas Border Coalition, formed by border mayors opposing the fence, has been turned down by the Department of Homeland Security for further consultations. Tamez and other landowners are considering legal action to protect their property rights.
: Christian pastors Rev. Charles Kennedy and Rev. James McLaughlin are incorporating Scientology teachings into their sermons and community programs, despite controversy surrounding the Church of Scientology. Kennedy uses L. Ron Hubbard's book "The Way to Happiness" as a supplement to his Pentecostal sermons, while McLaughlin integrates Scientology's "Narconon" drug rehab program with Christian teachings. Both pastors believe these Scientology-based methods help their predominantly lower-income, urban congregations address issues like crime, addiction, and lack of opportunity. Critics, however, view this blending of faiths as a marketing strategy for Scientology, while the Church of Scientology declined to comment.

: Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter star, turns 18 and gains access to a £20 million fortune. However, he plans not to be extravagant, preferring to spend on books, CDs, and DVDs. Despite his fame and wealth, Radcliffe aims to stay grounded, avoiding the "kid star goes off the rails" stereotype.

As an adult, he anticipates increased media scrutiny.
: CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien explores the "forgotten floor" of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, where mentally ill inmates await trial. Judge Steven Leifman, an advocate for justice and the mentally ill, explains that these individuals often face avoidable felonies due to confrontations with police, exacerbating their mental illness. The conditions on the ninth floor are harsh, with prisoners in sleeveless robes, no shoes, laces, or mattresses, designed to prevent self-harm. Approximately one-third of Miami-Dade county jail inmates are mentally ill, overwhelming the system. Leifman is working to change this by redirecting inmates to a new mental health facility starting in 2008, aiming for long-term treatment rather than punishment. This initiative is seen as a win-win solution, benefiting patients, families, and the state.

: Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick has been indefinitely suspended by the NFL without pay due to his involvement in a dogfighting ring. Vick admitted to federal prosecutors in Virginia that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not perform well in fighting sessions. The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, stated that Vick's actions were illegal, cruel, and tarnished the NFL's reputation. The Falcons could seek to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from his 2004 contract. Vick is expected to plead guilty to conspiracy charges related to the dogfighting ring and may face up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement, and Vick has agreed to cooperate with investigators and make restitution for the costs associated with the seized dogs.

: A study suggests that the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) found in healthy Australian honey bees may contribute to colony collapse disorder (CCD) in U.S. bee colonies. While IAPV is present in 96% of bees from CCD hives, researchers caution that CCD is likely caused by multiple factors, including genetic weaknesses, pathogens, pesticides, and pollutants. Varroa mites, not found in Australia, also affect U.S. hives. The study offers hope for breeding disease- and pest-resistant bees, with some Australian bees naturally resistant to IAPV. Further research is needed to understand the combined effects of IAPV and other stressors on bee health.

: Paul Lee, a chief subway technician in Hong Kong, paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a liver transplant from an executed prisoner in China's Tianjin city, saving his life. The dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries has led to foreigners traveling to poorer countries like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia, and the Philippines to buy new organs. In Pakistan, a "kidney bazaar" has emerged, with patients from Europe, Saudi Arabia, and India paying around $8,500 for a new kidney, often without medical care post-surgery. In Egypt, Karam paid $5,300 for his sister's kidney, while Hakan, a security guard in Istanbul, is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them, and stealing their kidneys, highlighting the need for regulation and transparency in the organ transplant trade.
: Hollywood filmmakers are debating whether to insure Lindsay Lohan's future movies following her recent legal troubles. While no actor is considered uninsurable, Lohan's high-risk status may lead to increased insurance costs, higher deductibles, or escrow requirements for her salary to cover potential production disruptions. Insurance rates for errant actors can range from 1% to 3% of a movie's budget. Fireman's Fund and Aon/Albert G. Ruben are examples of insurance brokers managing such risks, which may include medical exams, drug screenings, and even "minders" on set for known drug abuse cases.

: French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner challenges conventional diplomatic behavior by preparing France for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program. Known for his unconventional approach, Kouchner's stance aligns with France's new assertive diplomatic style under President Nicolas Sarkozy. While not advocating immediate military action, Kouchner emphasizes the escalating risks due to Iran's nuclear enrichment program. His intervention underscores France's intent to reclaim a prominent role in global diplomacy, without being a knee-jerk anti-American administration.
: 1. "It Ain't Me, Babe" - Bob Dylan wrote this song for Joan Baez, but it was originally titled "Bagatelle in A minor" and possibly written for Therese Malfatti.
2. "Philadelphia Freedom" - Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote this song as a thank-you to Billie Jean King for a tracksuit, referencing her tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms.

5. "Oh, Carol" - Neil Sedaka wrote this song for Carole King, which inspired King to write "Oh, Neil," leading to King and Gerry Goffin's successful careers as songwriters.
6. "It Ain't Me, Babe" - Again, Bob Dylan wrote this song for Joan Baez, but their relationship soured, leading Dylan to marry Sara Lownds.
7. "Our House" - Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young wrote this song inspired by a lazy Sunday spent with Joni Mitchell in their Laurel Canyon home.
: In the 2008 election cycle, political and issue-advocacy advertising spending is expected to exceed $3 billion, nearly double the $1.7 billion spent in 2004. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV ads among presidential contenders, airing his commercials over 11,000 times at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. Interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads for state and local ballot measures, with issue-advocacy TV ad spending reaching $270 million in the first nine months of the year. CMAG predicts over $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the presidential race, with more than $639 million potentially spent on congressional TV ads. However, the effectiveness of these ads may be diluted as voters become numb to the high volume of ads.

Despite their disagreements, both acknowledged the need for health care reform in the U.S.
: Some Democrats are reconsidering their support for a House resolution that labels Turkey's treatment of Armenians during World War I as genocide. Turkey, a key U.S. ally and NATO partner, threatened to block U.S. access to Incirlik Air Base, a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and the Mideast and Asia, if the resolution passes. The Pentagon is preparing alternative supply routes in case Turkey cuts off U.S. access to Incirlik. The U.S. military has issued a "warning order" to ensure alternative air crews, planes, fuel, and routes are ready. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives being considered. The pursuit of the resolution could potentially embolden Turkey to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, further complicating Iraqi stability.
: Mohammed Rasoul, a 12-year-old boy from Falluja, Iraq, lost his right leg below the knee due to an explosion. His mother, Jinan Khalifa, recalls the traumatic event.

: The immigration debate, according to Ruben Navarrette Jr., is primarily driven by cultural concerns rather than legal issues. Opponents fear changes in local culture due to the influx of immigrants, particularly Hispanic immigrants. They worry about the perceived erosion of American identity, the dominance of Spanish over English, and the transformation of Main Street into "Little Mexico." These fears harken back to historical instances of nativism and xenophobia, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and concerns about German and Irish immigrants in the late 18th and 19th centuries. The debate extends beyond legal distinctions of "legal" or "illegal" immigration, reflecting deep-seated anxieties about cultural assimilation and identity.

: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa, chief executive of Bahrain's Economic Development Board, expressed concerns that the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors. Despite Bahrain's push for economic reforms to reduce reliance on oil, the high crude prices near $100 a barrel have raised questions about the appetite for change.

: Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter star, turns 18 and gains access to a reported £20 million fortune. However, he plans not to be extravagant, preferring to spend on books, CDs, and DVDs. Despite his fame and wealth, Radcliffe aims to stay grounded, avoiding the "kid star goes off the rails" stereotype. He will continue his Harry Potter role in the last two films, while also working on other projects like "My Boy Jack," "December Boys," and a stage debut in "Equus." He anticipates increased media scrutiny as an adult.
: CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien explores the "forgotten floor" of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility, where mentally ill inmates await trial. Judge Steven Leifman, an advocate for justice and the mentally ill, explains that these individuals often face avoidable felonies due to confrontations with police, exacerbating their mental health issues. The conditions on the ninth floor are harsh, with no shoes, laces, or mattresses to prevent self-harm. Approximately one-third of Miami-Dade county jail inmates are mentally ill, overwhelming the system. Leifman aims to change this by redirecting inmates to a new mental health facility starting in 2008, offering long-term treatment instead of repeated incarceration. This initiative is seen as a win-win solution, benefiting patients, families, and the state.
: Survivors of the Minneapolis bridge collapse recounted harrowing tales of survival. Gary Babineau experienced a 30-35 foot free fall and helped rescue children from the collapsed bridge. Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, rushed to the scene and managed to get 55 people into ambulances within two hours. Bernie Toivonen's vehicle ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle but remained upright after the collapse. Melissa Hughes was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her, but she was unharmed despite a pickup truck landing on top of her car.
: Five small polyps were removed from President Bush's colon during a procedure at Camp David. The polyps, less than half an inch in diameter, were sent for microscopic examination at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Results are expected in two to three days. The president, under monitored anesthesia care, was asleep but not deeply unconscious. Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power during the procedure, which was supervised by Bush's physician, Dr. Richard Tubb, and conducted by a team from the National Naval Medical Center. No abnormalities were found during Bush's last colonoscopy in June 2002. The American Cancer Society recommends screening for colorectal cancer at age 50 for those without high risk factors or symptoms.
: Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick has been indefinitely suspended by the NFL without pay due to his involvement in a dogfighting ring. Vick admitted to federal prosecutors in Virginia that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not perform well in fighting sessions. The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, stated that Vick's actions were illegal, cruel, and tarnished the NFL's reputation. The Falcons could seek to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from his 2004 contract. Vick is expected to plead guilty to conspiracy charges related to the dogfighting ring and may face up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement, and Vick has agreed to cooperate with investigators and make restitution for the costs associated with the seized dogs.
: Youssif, a 5-year-old Iraqi boy severely burned in an attack, has received an outpouring of global support. The Children's Burn Foundation has agreed to cover all medical costs, including surgeries performed by Dr. Peter Grossman at the Grossman Burn Center. The foundation will also provide housing and social rehabilitation for Youssif and his family. However, obtaining the necessary visas for their travel to the United States remains a challenge due to security risks in Iraq. Despite these obstacles, Youssif's parents remain hopeful for their son's recovery.
: In Baghdad, Iraq, due to violence, increased cost of living, and lack of government aid, many women are forced into prostitution to support their families. Suha, a 37-year-old mother of three, and Karima, a widow with five children, are among those who have resorted to selling their bodies for as little as $8 a day. Despite the shame and fear associated with their actions, they believe it's a necessary sacrifice for their children's survival. Humanitarian workers, like the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq, are working to support these women and bring attention to their plight.
: Colombian military confirms the death of FARC rebel leader Tomas Medina Caracas, known as "El Negro Acacio," in an air attack on a guerrilla camp. Medina Caracas, indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking and conspiring to kidnap U.S. oil workers, managed FARC's cocaine trafficking network. The army's Rapid Response Force and Colombian Air Force tracked him down, resulting in the death of 14 rebels and the seizure of weapons, communications equipment, and GPS systems.
: Tony Snow, White House press secretary undergoing cancer treatment, steps down on September 14, to be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino. President Bush warmly accepts Snow's resignation, expressing confidence in his battle with cancer and his future contributions to society. Snow leaves to earn more money after taking a pay cut from his previous roles at Fox News. His health is improving, with stable tumors and no new growths, and he plans to continue speaking out on issues. Snow's black hair is expected to grow back in about a month.
: An empty 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube was discovered on the front lawn of a Jersey City home, leading to an investigation by the FBI and Jersey City police. The launcher, which is no longer operable and not considered a public safety hazard, has been turned over to the 754th Ordnance Company at Fort Monmouth. The origin and circumstances of the rocket launcher's appearance on residential property are being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police.
: President Bush compares the Iraq war to Vietnam, citing historical lessons to argue against withdrawal. He highlights the consequences of America's withdrawal from Vietnam, including the suffering of innocent citizens and the emboldening of today's terrorists. Bush also draws parallels to the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan post-WWII and the Korean War in the 1950s, emphasizing America's commitment to democracy and freedom. The speech aims to provide context for the upcoming Iraq progress report amid declining public support for the war.

: Carlos Alberto, FC Porto Champions League winner in 2004, joins Bundesliga club Werder Bremen for a club record fee of 7.8 million euros ($10.7 million). He previously played for Fluminense, Corinthians, and Borussia Dortmund. Ewerthon, another top Brazilian player, joins VfB Stuttgart on loan from Real Zaragoza. Ailton returns to Germany, signing with Duisburg from Red Star Belgrade.
: Vice President Dick Cheney will serve as acting president while President Bush undergoes a routine 2 1/2-hour colonoscopy at Camp David. No abnormalities were found during Bush's last colonoscopy in June 2002. The procedure will be supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb and conducted by a team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The American Cancer Society recommends colorectal cancer screening at age 50 for those without high-risk factors or symptoms. White House spokesman Tony Snow is also undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer.
: A magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck the San Francisco area at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), centered about two miles east-northeast of Oakland. Approximately 2,000 customers lost power, but no injuries or significant damage were reported. The quake lasted about 50 seconds and was felt indoors, potentially breaking dishes, windows, and overturning unstable objects.
: Six miners trapped in a Utah coal mine for nearly a month have been declared dead with "no remaining hope" of finding them alive. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) exhausted all known options after drilling seven holes into mine tunnels, finding no sign of the miners or any sound from them. Oxygen levels in the mine were too low to sustain human life. President Bush and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao expressed sympathy for the failed rescue efforts, which claimed three lives and injured six others. Murray Mining, the co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine where the miners were trapped, plans to permanently close and seal the mine.
: A bomb attack in Batna, Algeria, killed at least 14 people and wounded 60 others. The explosion occurred near a mosque, 20 meters from a security cordon, 15 minutes before President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika's arrival. Algeria's Interior Minister stated a suspect among the crowd attempted to breach security but escaped after the blast. No group claimed responsibility, amid ongoing Islamic insurgency in the country. President Bouteflika continued his visit, including a hospital visit for the injured.
: David Beckham, a renowned footballer, celebrity, and fashion icon, transitions to U.S. Major League Soccer with a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy. CNN's "Becks" Becky Anderson delves into Beckham's journey from east London to Hollywood Hills, examining his football career, marriage to Victoria, and adaptation to life in Los Angeles. The article also explores the impact of overseas stars on U.S. soccer, the David Beckham academy in L.A, and the changing perception of soccer in the U.S.A.
: A study suggests that the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) found in healthy Australian honey bees may contribute to colony collapse disorder (CCD) in U.S. bee colonies. IAPV was present in bees from CCD hives 96% of the time. However, researchers caution that CCD is likely caused by multiple factors, including genetic weakness, pathogens, pesticides, pollutants, and varroa mites, which are not found in Australia. The study offers hope for breeding disease- and pest-resistant bees, as some bees show genetic resistance to IAPV. Further research is needed to determine if IAPV alone or in combination with other factors can induce CCD in healthy bees.
: UK mortgage bank Northern Rock was bailed out by the Bank of England after cutting profit forecasts, leading to customers withdrawing about £1 billion. Despite reassurances from the bank and government, long lines formed at branches. The British Bankers' Association urged calm, while finance minister Alistair Darling said the intervention aimed to stabilize the banking system. Northern Rock's CEO confirmed the bank had not yet used the emergency funds.
: Former football star O.J. Simpson has been arrested and held without bail on charges of robbery and assault. He is accused of directing others in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia at a Las Vegas hotel. No information suggests Simpson carried a firearm during the incident. The alleged victims include sports memorabilia collector Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley, who later received an apology from Simpson. Four other men believed to have accompanied Simpson into the hotel room are also being sought by investigators. Simpson, previously acquitted of murder in 1995, faces the possibility of another prosecution.
: Nigeria's television survival show "Gulder Ultimate Search" has been suspended after a contestant, Anthony Ogadje, drowned during preparation. The show, sponsored by Dutch brewer Heineken's local unit, was set to start broadcasting on Thursday. Ogadje, along with nine other contestants, was preparing at Shere Hills Lake in Plateau State. Despite efforts by medical teams and lifeguards, including fellow contestants, Ogadje could not be revived, leading to the show's suspension. The prize money of 5 million naira (about $39,000) in cash, a four-wheel drive jeep, and 500,000 naira (about $3,900) for clothes, along with potential celebrity status and sponsorship deals, were at stake for the winner. The show, which began in 2004, had previously garnered high ratings.
: A former government contract employee, Roy Lynn Oakley, was indicted for stealing nuclear energy-related materials from the East Tennessee Technology Park, potentially endangering the United States. Oakley, a former Bechtel Jacobs employee, voluntarily surrendered at an FBI field office in Knoxville. The indictment alleges Oakley attempted to sell the materials to an undercover FBI agent posing as a French agent. Each count carries a possible sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Federal authorities have been investigating the case for at least six months.
: Chelsea waits on John Terry's fitness for Wednesday's Champions League match against Valencia, with Frank Lampard ruled out due to a thigh injury. Terry, recovering from a broken cheekbone, trained with a mask at Valencia's Mestalla stadium. Avram Grant will decide Terry's availability after Tuesday's training. Michael Essien, recovering from a leg injury, participated in training and is expected to play.
: Paul Lee, a chief subway technician in Hong Kong, paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a liver transplant from an executed Chinese prisoner, saving his life. In Egypt, Karam paid $5,300 to buy a kidney for his sister. Hakan, a security guard in Istanbul, is seeking $30,700 for one of his kidneys. The dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries has led to organ trafficking and a black market, with foreigners traveling to poorer countries like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia, and the Philippines to buy body parts. The World Health Organization estimates a global demand of at least 90,000 liver transplants annually, far exceeding the 20,000 carried out in China, which recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners. In Pakistan, a "kidney bazaar" has emerged, with patients from Europe, Saudi Arabia, and India paying around $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors receive $300 to $1,000 with no medical care post-surgery. Efforts to regulate or ban the trade face challenges due to unclear laws and vested interests.
: Hollywood filmmakers are debating whether to insure Lindsay Lohan's future movies following her recent legal troubles. While no actor is uninsurable, Lohan's arrest may lead to higher insurance costs and stricter conditions. Fireman's Fund, a leading film underwriter, may impose higher deductibles or require Lohan to put her salary into escrow to cover potential losses. Insurance rates for errant actors can range from 1% to 3% of a movie's production budget. Aon/Albert G. Ruben, an entertainment insurance broker, has experience creating policies for actors with legal and substance abuse issues. The decision on whether to proceed with Lohan's role in "Poor Things" is pending.
: Francesco Totti, a striker for Roma, threatens to quit the Italian Players Association due to disagreement over the start date of the next Serie A season, which was set for August 26, ignoring Italy coach Roberto Donadoni's request for a mid-month start to prepare for Euro 2008 qualifiers.
: Blackwater USA denies allegations of involvement in illegal arms activities in Iraq. Federal prosecutors are investigating claims that Blackwater employees unlawfully purchased and sold weapons. The company fired two employees involved in theft and cooperated with the ATF investigation. State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard confirmed cooperation with prosecutors. Blackwater resumed operations in Iraq after a brief suspension.
: Youssif, a 5-year-old Iraqi boy who suffered severe burns, had a dream come true when he met his favorite superhero, Spider-Man, at Universal Studios in Los Angeles. Alongside other superheroes and characters like SpongeBob, Lassie, and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie, Youssif enjoyed a day filled with joy and laughter, far removed from the chaos and violence he experienced in Baghdad. Despite the family's past traumas, including the kidnapping and murder of Youssif's father, they found solace and hope in America's generosity and peacefulness.
: Cpl. Trent D. Thomas, a Marine involved in the 2006 death of Iraqi civilian Hashim Ibrahim Awad, was found guilty of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit several offenses. He will be demoted and receive a bad-conduct discharge. Thomas initially pleaded guilty but later changed to not guilty, claiming obedience to orders. Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, the squad leader, faces life imprisonment if convicted.
